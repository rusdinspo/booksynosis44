Gawande draws on clinical studies, case histories and stories from his own experiences as a doctor and a son to illuminate the subject of mortality relative to modern medical systems. His treatment of the subject covers a broad range of institutions and individuals that shape the lives of the aged and terminally ill. The central thesis of the book is that the experience of the end of life has been problematized and addressed by medical models that place extending life over quality of life and institutional frameworks that place safety and efficiency over the ability for people to have autonomy over the last part of their lives. Gawande is a surgeon at Brigham and Women&#x2019;s Hospital and a professor at the Harvard Medical School. He is a writer at The New Yorker magazine and author of three New York Times bestselling books. <b>Download your copy today!</b> for a limited time discount of only $2.99!

Zofia Turboty&#x144;ska&#x2014;professor&#x2019;s wife and socialite&#x2014;is bored at home, with little to do but plan a charity auction sponsored by the wealthy residents of a local nursing home and the nuns who work there.<br><br> But when one of those residents is found dead, Zofia finds a calling: solving crimes. Ridiculed by the police, who have declared the deaths of natural cause, she starts her own murder investigation, unbeknownst to anyone but her loyal cook Franciszka and one reluctant nun. With her husband blissfully unaware of her secret, Zofia remakes herself into Cracow&#x2019;s greatest&#x2014;or at the very least, most surprising&#x2014;amateur detective.<br><br> Full of period character and charm,&nbsp;<i>Mrs. Mohr Goes Missing</i> proves that everyone is capable of finding their passion in life, however unlikely it may seem.</p><p>MARYLA SZYMICZKOWA is a pseudonym for partners Jacek Dehnel and Piotr Tarczynski.

Susan Hill&#39;s third crime novel, The Risk of Darkness-perhaps even more compulsive and convincing than its predecessors-explores the crazy grief of a widowed husband, whose derangement turns into obsession and threats, violence and terror. Meanwhile, handsome, introverted Simon Serrailler, whose cool reserve has broken the hearts of several women, finds his own heart troubled by the newest recruit to the Cathedral staff: a feisty female Anglican priest with red hair. The Risk of Darkness is truly the work of a writer at the top of her form.</p><p><b>Susan Hill</b>&#x2019;s novels and short stories have won the Whitbread Book, Somerset Maugham, and John Llewellyn Rhys Awards, the <i>Yorkshire Pos</i>t Book of the Year, and have been shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. The play adapted from her famous ghost novel, <i>The Woman in Black</i>, has been running in the West End since 1989. She lives in the UK.<b>One<br></b><br>There was no fly and there should have been a fly. It was that sort of room. Grey linoleum. Putty walls. Chairs and tables with tubular metal legs. But in these places there was always a fly too, zizzing slowly up and down a window pane. Up and down. Up and down. Up.<br><br>The wall at the far end was covered in whiteboards and pinboards. Names. Dates. Places. Then came: <br><br>Witnesses (which was blank).<br>Suspects. (Blank.)<br>Forensics. (Blank.)<br>In each case.<br><br>There were five people in the conference room of the North Riding Police HQ, and they had been staring at the boards for over an hour. DCI Simon Serrailler felt as if he had spent half his life staring at one of the photographs. The bright fresh face. The protruding ears. The school tie. The newly cut hair. The expression. Interested. Alert.<br><br>David Angus. It was eight months since he had vanished from outside the gate of his own house at ten past eight one morning. <br><br>David Angus. <br><br>Simon wished there was a fly to mesmerise him, instead of the small boy&#x2019;s face.<br><br>*<br><br>The call from DS Jim Chapman had come a couple of days earlier, in the middle of a glorious Sunday afternoon.<br><br>Simon had been sitting on the bench, padded up and waiting to bat for Lafferton Police against Bevham Hospital 2nd Eleven. The score was 228 for 5, the medics&#x2019; bowling was flaccid, and Simon thought his team might declare before he himself got in. He wasn&#x2019;t sure whether he would mind or not. He enjoyed playing though he was only an average cricketer. But on such an afternoon, on such a fine ground, he was happy whether he went in to bat or not.<br><br>The swifts soared and screamed high above the pavilion and swallows skimmed the boundary. He had been low-�spirited and restless during the past few months, for no particular reason and then again, for a host of them but his mood lightened now with the pleasure of the game and the prospect of a good pavilion tea. He was having supper with his sister and her family later. He remembered what his nephew Sam had said suddenly the previous week, when he and Simon had been swimming together; he had stopped mid-length, leaping up out of the water with: &#x2018;Today is a GOOD day!&#x2019;<br><br>Simon smiled to himself. It didn&#x2019;t take much. <br><br>&#x2018;Howzzzzzaaaattt?&#x2019;<br><br>But the cry faded away. The batsman was safe and going for his hundred.<br><br>&#x2018;Uncle Simon, hey!&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Hi, Sam.&#x2019;<br><br>His nephew came running up to the bench. He was holding the mobile, which Simon had given him to look after if he went in to bat.<br><br>&#x2018;Call for you. It&#x2019;s DCS Chapman from the North Riding CID.&#x2019; Sam&#x2019;s face was shadowed with anxiety. <br><br>&#x2018;Only, I thought I should ask who it was . . .&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;No, that&#x2019;s quite right. Good work, Sam.&#x2019;<br><br>Simon got up and walked round the corner of the pavilion.<br><br>&#x2018;Serrailler.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Jim Chapman. New recruit, was it?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Nephew. I&#x2019;m padded up, next in to bat.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Good man. Sorry to break into your Sunday afternoon. Any chance of you coming up here in the next couple of days?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;The missing child?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Been three weeks and not a thing.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I could drive up tomorrow early evening and give you Tuesday and Wednesday, if you need me that long &#x2014; once I&#x2019;ve cleared it.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I just did that. Your Chief thinks a lot of you.&#x2019;<br><br>There was a mighty cheer from the spectators and applause broke.<br><br>&#x2018;We&#x2019;re a man out, Jim. Got to go.&#x2019;<br><br>Sam was waiting, keen as mustard, holding out his hand for the mobile.<br><br>&#x2018;What do I do if it rings when you&#x2019;re batting?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Take the name and number and say I&#x2019;ll call back.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Right, guv.&#x2019;<br><br>Simon bent over and tightened the buckle on his pad to hide a smile.<br><br>But as he walked out to bat, a thin fog of misery clouded around his head, blocking out the brightness of the day, souring his pleasure. The child abduction case was always there, a stain on the recesses of the mind. It was not only the fact that it was still a blank, unsolved and unresolved, but that the boy&#x2019;s abductor was free to strike again. No one liked an open case, let alone one so distressing. The phone call from Jim Chapman had pulled Simon back to the Angus case, to the force, to work . . . and from there, to how he had started to feel about his job in the past few months. And why.<br><br>Facing the tricky spin-bowling of a cardiac registrar gave him something else to concentrate on for the moment. Simon hooked the first ball and ran. <br><br>The pony neighing from the paddock woke Cat Deerbon from a sleep of less than two hours. She lay, cramped and uncomfortable, wondering where she was. She had been called out to an elderly patient who had fallen downstairs and fractured his femur and on her return home had let the door bang and had woken her youngest child. Felix had been hungry, thirsty and cross, and in the end Cat had fallen asleep next to his cot. <br><br>Now, she sat up stiffly but his warm little body did not stir. The sun was coming through a slit in the curtains on to his face. <br><br>It was only ten past six.<br><br>The grey pony was standing by the fence grazing, but whinnied again, seeing Cat coming towards it, carrot in hand.<br><br>How could I leave all this? she thought, feeling its nuzzling mouth. How could either of us bear to leave this farmhouse, these fields, this village? <br><br>The air smelled sweet and a mist lay in the hollow. A woodpecker yaffled, swooping towards one of the oak trees on the far side of the fence.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Day after Oblivion</h2><p><b>AND SO IT BEGINS...</b><br> In the United States, the Department of Defense and the NSA computer networks have been hacked.

It is designed in scope to be adaptable for both beginning students who want to explore the experience of acting and develop basic skills for the first time and advanced students who want to improve their techniques. Five sections help readers discover the joy of acting: basic acting skills, preparing to perform a scene, techniques in character development, the play script, and film acting. Teachers will love the chapter-by-chapter planned sequence of explanations, exercises, activities, and discussion questions. This step-by-step approach offers the student a full range of experiences that should not only enhance acting abilities, but also increase self-awareness and cooperation among classmates.</p><p><b>Jack Frakes</b> is a published playwright and a member of the Screen Actors Guild.

How could I publish this text! What publisher would accept it? I think it would be impossible, unless a miracle occurs. I believe in miracles.</p><p>&#x201c;I love you and I promise to be good,&#x201d; I used to tell her, to gain her sympathy when I was a child and for a long time afterwards whenever I&#x2019;d ask her for a favor, until I learned she was famous for being an &#x201c;arbiter of the impossible.&#x201d; There are people who don&#x2019;t understand that you speak to a saint as you would to anybody. If they&#x2019;d known all my prayers they would have said they were sacrilegious and that I am not a devout believer in Saint Rita.</p><p>The statues or statuettes usually depict this saint holding a mysterious wooden book in her hand, which she presses against her heart. I never forgot the detail of this pose when I made her the promise that, if I were saved, I would write this book and finish it by the time my next birthday came around. That date is almost a year away. I&#x2019;ve begun to feel anxious. I thought it would be a big sacrifice to keep my promise. To make this dictionary of memories that are at times shameful, even humiliating, would mean giving over my intimacy to anyone. (Perhaps this anxiety was unfounded.)</p><p>I don&#x2019;t have a life of my own; I only have feelings. My experiences were of no importance, neither throughout my life, nor even on the threshold of death, but rather the lives of others become mine.</p><br><br><p>Copying these pages on the typewriter would be a thankless task, as I don&#x2019;t have the money to pay a typist to make the copies (neither do I have altruistic friends who know how to type). Presenting the manuscript to editors, to any publisher in the world who might refuse to publish the book, so that I would have to pay for it inevitably with the sale of objects I value or with some menial work, the only work of which I&#x2019;d be capable, would mean sacrificing my sense of pride.</p><p>How distant are those happy days when I would eat the chocolates in the Keystone Cop wrappers or the chewy white candies with my little nephews in Palermo, swinging on the swings, or sliding down the slide. Those times when I felt unhappy, now seem to me so joyful, when my nephews would get their hands so filthy playing in the dirt, that when we&#x2019;d go back home to my sister&#x2019;s house, instead of taking a bath or going to the movies, I would have to clean their nails with Carpincho saddle soap as if they had been in the Police Department Headquarters after leaving fateful fingerprints.</p><p> I, who always considered it useless to write a book, find myself committed to doing this today in order to keep a sacred promise to myself.</p><p>Three months ago, I boarded the <em>Anacreonte</em> bound for Cape Town, to visit the less tedious side of my family: a consul and his wife, cousins who always looked out for me. Everything we want too much turns out badly, or never happens at all. I got sick and had to return as soon as I arrived, because of an accident I had during the trip over there. I fell into the ocean. I slipped on the deck where they store the lifeboats when I leaned over the handrail to catch a brooch that hung from my scarf and had fallen off. How? I don&#x2019;t know. Nobody saw me fall. Maybe I fainted. I came to in the water dazed by the blow. I couldn&#x2019;t even remember my name. The ship was calmly moving away. I shouted. Nobody heard me. The ship seemed more immense than the sea. Fortunately, I&#x2019;m a good swimmer, though my form is quite deficient. After the first shock of cold and fear had passed, I glided slowly through the water. The heat, the noonday light helped me along. I almost forgot my fearful predicament because I love sports and I tried all the styles of strokes. At the same time I thought of the dangers the water could inflict upon me: sharks, sea serpents, jellyfish, waterspouts. The ebb and flow of the waves had a calming effect on me. I swam or floated on my back eight straight hours, waiting for the ship to return to pick me up. I sometimes wonder how I managed to nurture that hope, and honestly I don&#x2019;t know. At first I felt so much fear I couldn&#x2019;t think, then thoughts came to my mind haphazardly: I thought of schoolteachers, noodles, movies, prices, theater productions, the names of writers, titles of books, buildings, gardens, a cat, an unhappy love affair, a chair, a flower whose name I couldn&#x2019;t remember, a perfume, a toothpaste, etc. Memory: how you made me suffer! I suspected that I was about to die or that I had already died in the confusion of my memories. Then I noticed, upon feeling a sharp burning in my eyes caused by the salt water, that I was alive and far from dying since those who are drowning, it is known, are happy and I was not. After getting undressed, or being undressed by the sea in that way the sea undresses people as if with a lover&#x2019;s hands, there came a moment when sleep or the craving to sleep took hold of me. In order not to sleep, I imposed an order on my thoughts, a kind of mental journey or itinerary I now recommend to prisoners or patients who cannot move, or to the desperate who are on the verge of suicide.</p></p><h2>The Lost Stars: Tarnished Knight</h2><p>CEO Artur Drakon has been betrayed.

He lives with his indomitable wife and three children in Maryland.&nbsp;<b>Chapter One</b><p>Treason could be as simple as walking through a doorway.</p><p>At least that was true anywhere ruled by the Syndicate Worlds, and when the doorway in question had stenciled on it in large, red letters the words<i>Unauthorized Access Forbidden</i> OBSTLT. CEO Artur Drakon, commander of Syndicate World ground forces in the Midway Star System, had spent his life following rules like that and only partly because everyone knew that OBSTLT stood for <i>Or Be Subject to Life Termination</i>. &#x201c;Death&#x201d; was the sort of blunt term that the Syndicate Worlds&#x2019; bureaucracy liked to avoid no matter how freely it meted out that punishment.</p><p>No, he had obeyed because there hadn&#x2019;t been much choice while the endless war with the Alliance continued, when disobedience could leave a path open for the enemy to destroy homes and cities and sometimes entire worlds. And if the enemy didn&#x2019;t destroy your home as a result of your rebellious behavior, and if you somehow escaped the long and powerful reach of internal security, then the mobile forces of the Syndicate Worlds themselves would rain down death on your world from orbit in the name of law, discipline, and stability.</p><p>But now the war had ended in exhaustion and defeat. No one trusted the Alliance, but they had stopped attacking. And the mobile forces of the Syndicate Worlds, the once&#x2013;unassailable fist of the central government, had been almost wiped out in a flurry of destruction wrought by an Alliance leader who should have been dead a century ago.</p><p>That left the ISS, the Internal Security Service, to worry about. The &#x201c;snakes&#x201d; of the ISS were a very big worry indeed, but nothing that he couldn&#x2019;t handle now.</p><p>Drakon walked through the doorway. He could do that because multiple locks and codes had already been overridden, multiple alarm systems had been disabled or bypassed, a few deadly automated traps disarmed, and four human sentries in critical positions had been turned and now answered to him rather than to CEO Hardrad, head of internal security. All of this had been done on Drakon&#x2019;s orders. But until Drakon entered the room beyond he could claim to have been testing internal defenses. Now he had unquestionably committed treason against the Syndicate Worlds.</p><p>Drakon had expected to feel increased tension as he entered that room; instead, a sense of calm filled him. Retreat and alternate paths were no longer possible; there was no more room for uncertainty or questioning his decision. Within the next several hours, he would either win or die.</p><p>Inside, his two most trusted assistants were already busy at separate consoles. Bran Malin&#x2019;s fingers were flying as he rerouted and diverted surveillance data from all over the planet which should be streaming into the Internal Security Service headquarters complex. On the other side of the room, Roh Morgan used one hand to flick a strand of hair from her eyes as she rapidly entered false surveillance feed loops designed to fool the automated systems at ISS into thinking that everything still worked properly. Drakon was dressed in the dark blue executive ensemble every CEO was expected to wear, an outfit he personally detested, but both Malin and Morgan were clad in the tight, dull black skin suits designed to be worn under mechanized combat armor. The skin suits also served well on their own for breaking and entering, though.</p><p>Malin sat back, rubbing his neck with his right hand, then smiled at Drakon. &#x201c;ISS is blind, sir, and they don&#x2019;t even know it.&#x201d;</p><p>Drakon nodded as he studied the display. &#x201c;Malin, you&#x2019;re a wizard.&#x201d;</p><p>Morgan stretched like a cat, lithe and deadly, then stood up, leaning against the nearest wall with her arms crossed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the one who got us in here and entered the deception loops. What does that make me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A witch?&#x201d; Malin asked, his expression and voice deadpan.</p><p>For a moment, Morgan tensed, then one corner of her mouth curled upward as she gazed at Malin. &#x201c;Did I tell you that I&#x2019;d calculated the lowest possible cost to fire a single shot from a hand weapon, Malin?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. Why should I care?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because it came out to thirteen centas. That&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re still alive. I realized killing you wasn&#x2019;t worth the expense.&#x201d;</p><p>Malin bared his teeth at her as he drew his combat knife and balanced it on one palm. &#x201c;This wouldn&#x2019;t cost a centa to use. Go ahead and give it a try.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nah.&#x201d; Morgan stood away from the wall, flexing her hands. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d still have to put some effort into it, and like I said, you&#x2019;re not worth whatever energy it would take to kill you. CEO Drakon, we should eliminate those four sentries. They could still betray us.&#x201d;</p><p>Drakon shook his head. &#x201c;They were promised that if they played along they, and their families, wouldn&#x2019;t be killed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So? If they were stupid enough to believe the promise of a CEO&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was <i>my </i>promise,&#x201d; Drakon interrupted. &#x201c;I made a commitment. If I violate that, I won&#x2019;t be able to count on anyone else&#x2019;s believing I&#x2019;ll do what I say.&#x201d;</p><p>Morgan shook her head with a long&#x2013;suffering look. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the attitude that got you stuck out here in the back end of nowhere. As long as they&#x2019;re afraid of you, it doesn&#x2019;t matter whether or not they believe you.&#x201d;</p><p>Malin pretended to applaud, his palms clapping together silently. &#x201c;You know the first workplace rule for Syndicate Worlds&#x2019; CEOs. Very good. Now think about the fact that we <i>lost the war</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I operate the way that works for me,&#x201d; Drakon told Morgan, who was pretending not to have heard Malin.</p><p>She shrugged. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your rebellion. I&#x2019;ll check on the assault preparations and get the troops moving as planned.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me know if any problems develop,&#x201d; Drakon replied. &#x201c;I appreciate your support in this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That was always a given.&#x201d; Morgan started to leave, now ignoring Malin&#x2019;s presence completely.</p><p>&#x201c;And, Morgan . . .&#x201d;</p><p>She paused in the doorway.</p><p>&#x201c;The sentries will <i>not </i>be killed.&#x201d; He said it flatly and with force.</p><p>&#x201c;I heard you the first time,&#x201d; Morgan replied, then continued on out.</p><p>After the door closed, Malin looked at Drakon. &#x201c;Sir, if she notifies the snakes of what we&#x2019;re planning, she&#x2019;ll end up in command and you&#x2019;ll be dead.&#x201d;</p><p>Drakon shook his head. &#x201c;Morgan won&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t trust her. You must know that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know that she is loyal to me,&#x201d; Drakon said, keeping his voice even.</p><p>&#x201c;Morgan doesn&#x2019;t understand loyalty. She&#x2019;s using you for her own purposes, which remain hidden. The moment you&#x2019;re no longer useful, she might put a shot in your back. Or a knife,&#x201d; Malin finished, raising his own knife meaningfully before resheathing it with a single thrust.</p><p><i>Morgan has told me the same thing about you</i>, Drakon thought as he considered a reply to Malin. &#x201c;Morgan realizes that she couldn&#x2019;t count on the snakes rewarding her for turning us in. They&#x2019;d be just as likely to shoot her, too, no matter what agreement they had reached with her. Morgan knows that just as well as I do. But I am keeping an eye on her. I keep an eye on everyone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re still alive.&#x201d; Malin shook his head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not suggesting that you get rid of her. As long as she&#x2019;s alive, you need to have her where you can watch her.&#x201d;</p><p>Drakon paused, eyeing Malin. &#x201c;Are you advising that I take care of the &#x2019;as long as she&#x2019;s alive&#x2019; part?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir,&#x201d; Malin answered.</p><p>&#x201c;Then you&#x2019;d better not be planning to take care of that yourself. I know it&#x2019;s common practice with some CEOs&#x2019; subordinates, but I don&#x2019;t tolerate those kinds of games on my staff. It&#x2019;s bad for discipline, and it plays hell with the working environment.&#x201d;</p><p>Malin grinned. &#x201c;I will not kill Morgan.&#x201d; His smile faded, and Malin gave a worried glance upward. &#x201c;We can take down the Internal Security Service on the surface, we <i>will </i>take them down, but if the mobile forces in this star system aren&#x2019;t also neutralized we&#x2019;ll be sitting ducks. From what I know of the mobile forces commander, CEO Kolani, she will support the Syndicate government and the snakes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As long as we eliminate the ISS snakes on the surface, CEO Iceni will handle CEO Kolani and the mobile forces.&#x201d; <i>I hope</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Sir,&#x201d; Malin said with exaggerated care, &#x201c;if I may, I understand that you and CEO Iceni have agreed to run things here jointly. You are justified in believing that it is in her self&#x2013;interest to stick to that agreement. But how will you run things, sir? I know how unhappy you are with the Syndicate government&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sick to death of the Syndicate government,&#x201d; Drakon interrupted. &#x201c;Sick of watching my every step and every word.&#x201d; It felt strange to be able to say that, now that the snake surveillance gear was neutralized. &#x201c;Sick of bureaucrats a hundred light&#x2013;years away making life&#x2013;and&#x2013;death decisions about me.&#x201d;</p><p>Malin nodded in agreement. &#x201c;There are many who feel the same way even though few have dared to say it, even in private. But I am unclear as to what system will replace that of the Syndicate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you?&#x201d; Drakon smiled wryly. &#x201c;Me, too. Iceni and I couldn&#x2019;t talk about it before this, before we had these surveillance systems short&#x2013;circuited. Too great a chance of being caught by the ISS. We both agree that we want to get out from under the merciless thumb of the Syndicate. We both agree that the Syndicate government proved its incompetence, and that we can&#x2019;t depend on that government to defend this star system or to keep us safe. That&#x2019;s always been the argument, that we have to accept tight controls on everything we do in exchange for security. You and I and everyone else knows how false that proved to be. And now we know that the Syndicate government is moving to try to maintain control by replacing CEOs wholesale and executing anyone whose loyalty is doubted in any way. It&#x2019;s revolt or die. Beyond that . . . Iceni and I will talk when the snakes are dead.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Syndicate system failed, sir,&#x201d; Malin agreed. &#x201c;The control has always been there, but it didn&#x2019;t provide the promised security. I strongly advise that you consider another way of governing.&#x201d;</p><p>Drakon eyed Malin, knowing why he hadn&#x2019;t brought that up in front of Morgan, who would surely have reacted with derision at the idea of anything less than an ironfisted dictatorship. &#x201c;Your advice is noted. Our priority for the moment is survival. If we achieve that, we&#x2019;ll think about how to run things without repeating the mistakes of the Syndicate. I don&#x2019;t want anyone like the snakes working for me to keep the citizens in line, but I also know we need order and that means some control. Now I need to talk to Iceni so she knows this surveillance node is blinded, and so we both know the other is getting ready to move.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do it in person, sir. Even though we should&#x2019;ve blinded ISS, they might have some security taps we&#x2019;re not aware of yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope not.&#x201d; Drakon nodded farewell to Malin, then made his way out through the multiple layers of security that had protected the main surveillance node. The sensors watched him but saw nothing, feeding routine images of empty hallways and sealed doors to their masters at ISS, the men and women responsible for the very broad range of actions categorized as internal security on Syndicate Worlds&#x2019; planets. He passed by the armored room where two of the turned sentries were pretending to see nothing. Then a little farther along before he reached the new, concealed access that had been painstakingly dug into this building from a neighboring structure, a task that itself had been a very delicate operation, requiring diverting and spoofing various alarms and sensors as well as the cooperation of those co&#x2013;opted sentries. Walking down a roughly hewn passage, Drakon entered the basement area of a shopping center, ignoring surveillance cameras there which had also been blinded, then went up a set of stairs and through an EMPLOYEES ONLY door whose lock combination had long since been compromised.</p><p><i>The ISS snakes are going to be in for a real shock in a few hours,</i> Drakon thought. <i>For over two hundred years, the snakes have been staging surprise arrests and security sweeps. Now we&#x2019;ll see how they like surprises.</i></p><p>It would have been nice to be able just to hit the snakes right now, but Drakon knew the process was like a long line of dominoes that had to fall in turn, each knocking down the next as the plan progressed, as sensors and spies and surveillance gear all over the planet were spoofed or silenced, as military forces loyal to Drakon began to move under cover of those actions, as rebellion gathered without the knowledge of those who could still inflict terrible damage to this world if not taken by surprise. So he kept to the plan, which had been unfolding slowly for months now and would soon begin moving very quickly indeed.</p><p>That was why Drakon wore his executive suit despite his dislike for the garment mandated for all CEOs. No average citizen seeing him could tell by his outfit whether he was assigned to overseeing manufacturing or sales or administration or any other aspect of the integrated economic, military, and political system of the Syndicate Worlds. Having spent almost his entire adult life in the ground forces, risking death and leading troops, Drakon didn&#x2019;t care for the thought of being outwardly indistinguishable from someone who had spent the same amount of time in advertising. He had once even suffered the indignity of being mistaken for a lawyer.</p><p>But he knew that he had to appear to conform to routine right now in order to avoid tipping off the ISS. Drakon walked briskly but without any sign of concern by storefronts and out of the mall, then turned to walk past the outside of the nondescript building that secretly housed the ISS surveillance relay facility. It took practice to look truly casual when you were guilty and strolling past those charged with enforcing laws, but no one reached the rank of CEO without plenty of experience at doing so.</p><p>The citizens he encountered on the streets automatically moved aside when they saw the CEO&#x2013;level executive suit, some eagerly seeking eye contact on the chance that a CEO might take notice of them, but just as many striving to avoid attracting his attention. Citizens of the Syndicate Worlds learned their own lessons, and one of those was that the attention of a CEO was a double&#x2013;edged sword which might bring benefits or calamity.</p><p>Watching the citizens react with mingled fear and fawning submission, the first real and the second probably faked, Drakon thought about Malin&#x2019;s recent words. What would come next? He had been consumed with figuring out how to kill the snakes without having half of this planet blown apart, and what he had said about not being able to discuss the matter with Iceni was true. They had barely been able to risk the few, occasional, and brief meetings in which coded phrases and words sketched out the agreement to cooperate in taking down the snakes, saving their own hides, and perhaps giving this star system a chance to survive the ongoing collapse of the Syndicate empire. Midway would either get caught in the death throes of the Syndicate Worlds or get free of that tyranny and look out for itself.</p><p>But after that? All he knew was the Syndicate way, and as Malin said that had failed. How else did you keep things running without everything&#x2019;s falling apart? The Alliance way? He had learned little...</p></p><h2>Orrin Porter Rockwell: Man of God, Son of Thunder</h2><p><p>The legend of the Destroying Angel of Mormondom was well established by the time of his death, of natural causes, in 1878. Travelers sang ballads about him as they gathered around their campfires at night. Mothers used his name to frighten children into obedience. He was accused of literally hundreds of murders, all in the name of the Mormon Church. <br><br>Yet behind all the myth was a man, a human being. Orrin Porter Rockwell believed in his prophet, Joseph Smith. He spent most of a year chained in an Independence dungeon for his belief, then walked across Missouri to Nauvoo, stumbling into Joseph&#x2019;s house on Christmas Day. Joseph said to him then, &#x201c;Cut not thy hair and no bullet or blade can harm thee,&#x201d; and the legend was born.<br><br>Rockwell continued to serve the leaders of his church&#x2014;as hunter, guide, messenger, scout, guerilla, emissary to the Indians, and lawman. He traveled thousands of miles, raised three families, accumulated land and wealth&#x2014;and favorably impressed almost everyone who met him. But although he walked with presidents and generals, scholars and scoundrels, in a life lived at the center of many of the great events of the American frontier, he has remained an enigma, a source of continuing controversy.<br><br>Harold Schindler&#x2019;s remarkable investigative skills led him into literally thousands of unlikely places in his search for the truth about Rockwell. Dale L. Morgan, one of the west&#x2019;s foremost historians, called the first edition &#x201c;...an impressive job of research, one of the most impressive in recent memory, in the Mormon field. Mr. Schindler has shown great energy and sagacity in dealing with a difficult, highly controversial subject; and he has also made maximum use of the latest scholarship and newly available archival resources.&#x201d;<br><br>But the author was not satisfied until he had probed even more deeply, and this revised and enlarged second edition contains greatly expanded documentation as well as textual additions that flesh out the characters and events of this classic drama of early America.<br></p></p><p><p><b>Harold Schindler</b> has been associated with the <i>Salt Lake Tribune</i> in various capacities since 1945. Shortly after the first edition of this book was published, he became a found (and charter Vice-President) of the Utah Westerners, an organization of scholars, writers, and dedicated enthusiasts founded upon fellowship and a commin interest in the history of Utah and the heritage of the west. In 1967 <i>Orrin Porter Rockwell</i> was awarded the prestigious Award of Merit of the American Association for State and Local History.<br><br><b>Dale Bryner</b>, whose stunning illustrations continue to enhance the narrative of this second edition, is a professor of art at Weber State College in Ogden, Utah. He is a photographer, painter and designer as well, who has worked and studied abroad during seven extended visits, including an entire year's sabbatical in Japan. Recently he has created a number of architectural glass designs for business establishments throughout the Salt Lake Valley.</p>"Harold Schindler has attempted to strip away churchly whitewash and Gentile vitriol to reveal Rockwell as he was. At once a Mormon and a trained police reporter, Schindler comes well-equipped for the job. He is dispassionate in an area of American history long marred by partisanship."&#x2014;<i>Saturday Review</i><br><br><br>"It is clear that this will be one of the light-bringing books&#x2014;or maybe one should call them books that clear the muddied waters....We can use it, and more, like it."&#x2014;Wallace Stegner<br><br><br>"Because of the depth of primary research, ...this account will undoubtedly stand for some time as the standard volume on the subject."&#x2014;Thomas G. Alexander, Brigham Young University<br><br>"One of the best biographies of its kind."&#x2014;<i>The Los Angeles Times</i><br><br><br><br>&#x201c;Schindler presents an understanding of Porter Rockwell, a tough frontier-coarsened fanatic for cause.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>&#x201c;As the subject emerges from the legendary towards reality in the hands of the author the reader is introduced to a facet of history usually skirted in objective writing. The author neither indicts nor clears Rockwell of the dark deeds laid to his charge by the enemies of the Church who insisted that he belonged to, or perhaps even headed, an avenging Danite group.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought</i><br><br><br>&#x201c;Readers of this volume will doubtless be surprised to find how closely associated Rockwell was with the mainstream of Mormon history, and how close he was to the church hierarchy&#x2014;from the earliest beginnings of his church until his dying day. As his life drew to an end, Rockwell had been a member of the church longer than any of his living contemporaries. By following the chain of events through the pages of this book, one gets a running sketch of Mormon history, as well as the activities of one of its most devout members.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;Arizona and the West</i></p><h2>Paid in Blood (A Buckhorn Western)</h2><p><b>Johnstone Justice.

Graham&#x2019;s first comic has long been out of print, but Image rectifies that with new editions collecting every issue. There is a lot here for fans of odd stories to enjoy, but don&#x2019;t expect a linear plot. Graham&#x2019;s stories are random snapshots of life on the road, interspersed with the adventures of Nura, another smuggler. His highly detailed, offbeat art ties everything together. Like he does with the nonlinear plot, he eschews ordinary panels, allowing the illustrations to tumble over themselves excitedly. Readers will want to savor the myriad details and silly puns.

In the early part of the twentieth century, a woman began a process of &#34;automatic writing&#34; - as though she were an instrument for someone else&#39;s words. Days later she discovered that the &#34;writer&#34; - identified as attorney and author David Patterson Hatch - died thousands of miles away, and he was telling his story of life after death through her. The resulting book, originally published as Letters from a Living Dead Man in 1914, gained widespread popularity and was hailed for helping remove the fear of dying. An eyewitness account of the afterlife, told while the storyteller was there, the book describes life after death in minute detail, including the consequences of suicide, how loved ones find each other, and the relationship with higher beings.</p><p></p><h2>Build Strong Healthy Feet: Banish Aches &amp; Pains</h2><p><p>Feet are often the most ignored, yet vitally important part of the body.

Glades, prairies, forests, wetlands, rivers, and caves form a biologically diverse patchwork that is unique to the state. <i>Kentucky's Natural Heritage: An Illustrated Guide to Biodiversity</i> provides an essential reference to the remarkable natural history of the commonwealth and is a rallying call for the conservation of this priceless legacy.<br><br>Kentucky's ecosystems teem with diverse native species, some of which are found nowhere else in the world. <i>Kentucky's Natural Heritage</i> brings these sometimes elusive creatures into close view, from black-throated green warblers to lizard skin liverworts. The aquatic systems of the state are home to rainbow darters, ghost crayfish, salamander mussels, and an impressive array of other species that constitute some of the greatest levels of freshwater diversity on the planet.<br><br><i>Kentucky's Natural Heritage</i> presents a persuasive argument for conservation of the state's biodiversity. Organized by a team from the Kentucky State Nature Preserves Commission, the book is an outgrowth of the agency's focus on biodiversity protection.<br><br>Richly detailed and lavishly illustrated with more than 250 color photos, maps, and charts, Kentucky's Natural Heritage is the definitive compendium of the commonwealth's amazing diversity. It celebrates the natural beauty of some of the most important ecosystems in the nation and presents a compelling case for the necessity of conservation.</p><p><p>Although any nature lover walking through one of the Kentucky's more than fifty nature reserves can observe the diverse population of flora and fauna, few truly understand the importance of the biological, geographical, and cultural history of Kentucky in the context of biodiversity. Kentucky's Natural Heritage provides an essential illustrated reference to Kentucky's remarkable natural history, while emphasizing the importance of conserving the unique biological environment to which the Commonwealth is home. </p><p>From the Mississippi Piedmont rivers to the Appalachian mesophytic forests, the state hosts a vast range of ecosystems that have been internationally recognized for their biodiversity. Kentucky is made up of three natural regions: the Coastal Plains, the Interior Low Plateaus, and the Appalachian Highlands. These three areas are drastically different from each other in climate, geology, topography, and soils; consequently, the flora and fauna found in each are often specific to that area. For example, the Orangefin Darter can be found in the Green River ecosystem -- and nowhere else in the world. </p><p>The book also serves as a call to arms for conservation of the state's numerous natural communities. The authors outline the threats that could potentially destroy the biodiversity in the state, and discuss the need for and methods of conservation of the area. They also stress that ecosystems are dynamic and that the fluctuation in population of one species can drastically affect the rest of the ecological web, thus highlighting the delicate balances that exist within such environments. The preservation of these fragile systems continues to be a relatively hot-button issue since former Governor Paul E. Patton commissioned the Kentucky Biodiversity Task Force in an effort to sustain biodiversity in the state.</p><p>Kentucky's Natural Heritage was spearheaded by a team from the Kentucky State Nature Preserves Commission and consists of entries written by over fifteen of the state's most noted naturalists. Complete with maps, charts, and nearly 200 photos, this book will please both the academic reader and anyone interested in the state's natural heritage. It is the first book to describe holistically the connections between the environment, the landscape, the flora, and the fauna of Kentucky in a time when such connections are in danger of being broken forever.</p>Kentucky State Nature Preserves Commission, part of the Energy and Environment Cabinet, was created in 1976.<br><br><b>Greg Abernathy</b> is a geographic information systems specialist with the Kentucky State Nature Preserves Commission.<br><br><b>Deborah White</b>, natural heritage branch manager and senior botanist at the Kentucky State Nature Preserves Commission, is a coauthor of Rare Wildflowers of Kentucky.<br><br><b>Ellis L.

He estimated it could hold twenty Demeters, the special mission ship attached to the Full Circle Fleet that was his responsibility. He lost his way three times between the shuttlebay and Admiral Kathryn Janeway&#x2019;s quarters.<br> <br>It was possible he wasn&#x2019;t lost, so much as dreading making his request of the fleet&#x2019;s new commanding officer. He paused for almost a full minute once he reached her door before activating the chime and announcing himself.<br> <br>&#x201c;Enter,&#x201d; the admiral said.<br> <br>No turning back now.<br> <br>&#x201c;Commander O&#x2019;Donnell,&#x201d; Janeway greeted him as he stepped over the threshold to her private office and residence aboard the Vesta. He had seen her once before, at the memorial service on New Talax, and they hadn&#x2019;t spoken that evening. She was shorter than he remembered&#x2014;diminutive, in fact&#x2014;but her stature was the only small thing about her. A genuine smile of welcome radiated over her fair face as she moved toward him, extending her right hand and grasping his firmly. Her presence easily filled the room, giving the space a warm, homey feel. She even made the incredibly restrictive full-dress uniform she wore look comfortable.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your reputation precedes you, Commander,&#x201d; Janeway said as she shook his hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so pleased to finally meet you, and eager to hear more from you about the last few weeks you&#x2019;ve spent with the Confederacy. It goes without saying that your work thus far with the fleet, your efforts to communicate with the Children of the Storm and to aid the wave forms recently discovered, has been exemplary. I trust I can count on more of the same from you.&#x201d;<br> <br>O&#x2019;Donnell sighed as he released her hand. No one who knew him had ever been this happy to see him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, Admiral,&#x201d; he responded uneasily. He noted her smile falter and added keen awareness to the list of attributes he was in the process of applying to Janeway.<br> <br>&#x201c;Obviously there won&#x2019;t be time now to hear your full report,&#x201d; Janeway began.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Donnell agreed.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Ceremony of Welcoming begins in less than an hour.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes&#x2014;about that,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Donnell interrupted.<br> <br>Janeway stepped back, analyzing him without making her attention feel intrusive.<br> <br>Quite the diplomat, O&#x2019;Donnell added to his list.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is there a problem?&#x201d; Janeway finally asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Depends,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Donnell replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;On what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your definition of the term, Admiral,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Donnell clarified.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go on.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Request permission not to attend the ceremony tonight, Admiral,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Donnell said.<br> <br>He read more curious amusement than anger at his request, which was a good start.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m really not good at parties,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Donnell replied.<br> <br>The admiral crossed her arms at her chest, her eyes shining mischievously.<br> <br>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t just a party, Commander,&#x201d; Janeway said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a diplomatic mission.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All the more reason you don&#x2019;t want me there,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Donnell insisted.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been the Federation&#x2019;s chief representative among the Confederacy for almost two weeks,&#x201d; Janeway said. &#x201c;Was it a mistake to ask you to assume that role?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, Admiral,&#x201d; he assured her. &#x201c;One-on-one, small groups, I&#x2019;m fine. When there&#x2019;s a specific problem in front of me to solve, I&#x2019;ll gladly talk your ear off. But large groups like this; I never know what to do with myself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So small talk is the issue?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I would have skipped my own wedding reception had my wife allowed it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Janeway chuckled. She seemed to consider taking mercy on him, but the amusement fled quickly from her face.<br> <br>&#x201c;Request denied, Commander,&#x201d; she said with finality.<br> <br>&#x201c;Admiral,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Donnell began.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are one of a handful of officers already acquainted with many of the diplomats who will be present tonight,&#x201d; Janeway said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be expecting you to make casual introductions. And they will most certainly note your absence and might take it as an insult.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t they more likely to take my genuine discomfort and displeasure at attending the function as an insult?&#x201d; O&#x2019;Donnell asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you allowed yourself to betray any of those emotions, I&#x2019;m sure they would,&#x201d; Janeway replied. &#x201c;So you will be your best, most personable self tonight. Do I need to make that a direct order?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;It wouldn&#x2019;t help, Admiral,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Donnell said. &#x201c;I did not make this request lightly. I&#x2019;m not here simply because I believe there are a thousand things I could do with the next few hours that would be more constructive than attending this ceremony, although there are. I cannot pretend to be something I am not. It&#x2019;s a valuable skill but one I never took the time to acquire. My feelings will be read clearly on my face, whether I wish them to or not. I would spare all of us the accompanying embarrassment. Commander Fife is prepared to take my place and will much better serve our interests.&#x201d;<br> <br>Janeway looked away for a moment, clearly reflecting on his words. Finally, she said, &#x201c;A few months ago, your ship was captured by the Children of the Storm. There were no telepaths aboard your vessel, so you could not communicate directly with them. Based solely on their behavior, you decided that their primary interest in Demeter was observing the growth cycles of the botanical life-forms aboard. You were willing to risk your ship, your crew, and your life on this intuitive leap. To gain their trust, you departed your vessel in an environmental suit and used an untested tool to inject a hybrid life-form you had created into one of the Children, hoping that it would grow.&#x201d;<br> <br>Janeway&#x2019;s clear blue eyes locked with O&#x2019;Donnell&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Did I misread or misremember that report?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, Admiral.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You risked death for that first contact, Commander. Why are you unwilling to risk considerably less for this one?&#x201d;<br> <br>O&#x2019;Donnell&#x2019;s eyes remained fixed on Janeway&#x2019;s. &#x201c;The Children had earned my respect and my compassion. For all our apparent differences, we were kindred spirits. I cannot say the same for the Confederacy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br> <br>O&#x2019;Donnell shrugged. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re rich. They&#x2019;re powerful. They believe they are the center of the civilized universe,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Their charms and social graces could induce insulin resistance. The only species they&#x2019;ve ever encountered that was immune to their hospitality or unimpressed by their technological accomplishments was the Borg. That&#x2019;s about to change, and while part of me is curious to see that realization take hold, the rest of me already knows how this story has to end.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And how is that, Commander?&#x201d; Janeway asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;With disappointment,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Donnell replied.<br> <br>Janeway considered his words, then said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s always a possibility. But those of us tasked with making first contact must always remember that where there is common ground, the opportunity to move beyond disappointment toward mutual understanding and acceptance also exists.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course, Admiral,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Donnell agreed.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you in the shuttlebay at 1800,&#x201d; Janeway said, dismissing him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye, Admiral.&#x201d;<br> <br>VOYAGER<br> <br>As Commander B&#x2019;Elanna Torres&#x2019;s fingers slipped and failed to close her full-dress jacket for the fifteenth time, she cursed under her breath. Her daughter Miral was watching her closely, and she took great delight in repeating every word that fell from her mother&#x2019;s lips at the most inopportune moments possible.<br> <br>Come on, Torres thought, gritting her teeth, wiping her sweaty fingers on her pants and redoubling her efforts.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s still time to replicate a new one,&#x201d; suggested Lieutenant Nancy Conlon, Voyager&#x2019;s chief engineer and one of B&#x2019;Elanna&#x2019;s closest friends. Conlon wasn&#x2019;t attending the ceremony and had offered to play with Miral until her bedtime. Both were sprawled on the floor of Torres&#x2019;s quarters amidst magnetic building blocks, but neither had eyes for anything at the moment beyond B&#x2019;Elanna&#x2019;s attempt to force herself into her dress uniform.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need a new one,&#x201d; Torres insisted. &#x201c;This is already a full size larger than my normal one.&#x201d; Releasing all of the air in her lungs and pulling her abdomen into its flattest orientation, she refused to take another breath. Finally, the jacket relented.<br> <br>&#x201c;See?&#x201d; Torres said, raising her hands to pose for them.<br> <br>Conlon bit both of her lips to hide a smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Torres demanded.<br> <br>&#x201c;The point was for your pregnancy not to show, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Torres replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mirror,&#x201d; Conlon suggested.<br> <br>Dropping her arms, B&#x2019;Elanna ducked into her bedroom and examined her reflection in the full-length mirror affixed to the wall beside the threshold. There was no arguing that the jacket was now closed, but it was already pulling apart and the fabric stretched unflatteringly across her stomach. More important, the short waist of the jacket emphasized her rounding lower abdomen rather than drawing attention away from it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Damn it,&#x201d; Torres said without thinking.<br> <br>&#x201c;Damn it,&#x201d; Miral instantly repeated from the living room.<br> <br>&#x201c;Miral Paris,&#x201d; Torres said, the warning clear in her voice as she returned to the living area and crossed to the replicator.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, Mommy,&#x201d; Miral said instantly.<br> <br>As Torres hastily ordered a new dress uniform jacket a size and a half larger than normal and extra long, she wondered if whoever had designed these torture devices had ever considered the possibility that a pregnant officer might need to wear one. Miral came to her mother&#x2019;s side and, looking up, asked, &#x201c;Is the baby still a secret, Mommy?&#x201d;<br> <br>Draping a hand over her daughter&#x2019;s shoulder and pulling her close, Torres replied, &#x201c;No, honey. Not anymore.&#x201d;<br> <br>Miral turned back to Conlon and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to have a baby brother.&#x201d;<br> <br>Conlon laughed in genuine delight. &#x201c;I know. It&#x2019;s exciting, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And I am going to teach him everything I know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I bet you are,&#x201d; Conlon said.<br> <br>&#x201c;And I will be the mommy and he will be the baby.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whoa there, kiddo,&#x201d; Torres said, pulling on her new jacket and relieved by how much better it felt than the first. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m always the mommy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But when you and Daddy aren&#x2019;t here, I get to be the mommy,&#x201d; Miral insisted.<br> <br>&#x201c;You get to be the big sister,&#x201d; Torres corrected her gently.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a lot of responsibility,&#x201d; Conlon said. &#x201c;I was a big sister, you know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You had a baby brother?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I had a baby sister.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where is she?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s home.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My daddy went home,&#x201d; Miral said, her face suddenly clouding over.<br> <br>Fully dressed and able to breathe, Torres bent to one knee to meet Miral at her eye level. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, honey. But he&#x2019;s going to be back before you know it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Before the baby comes?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Definitely,&#x201d; Torres assured her.<br> <br>Miral sighed. She was doing her three-and-a-half-year-old best to accept the sudden departure of her beloved daddy. It had been more than a week since he left, and her fits of sudden sadness were most intense near bedtime and first thing in the morning. &#x201c;I want my daddy,&#x201d; she finally admitted softly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Torres said, pulling her into a tight hug.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was thinking that instead of playing here tonight, I might take you to one of my favorite ice cream shops on the holodeck,&#x201d; Conlon said, rising and crossing to Miral.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ice cream?&#x201d; Miral asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you like hot fudge?&#x201d;<br> <br>Miral&#x2019;s eyes widened as she nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; Conlon said with a wink. &#x201c;You ready?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Miral said.<br> <br>Torres mouthed a sincere &#x201c;thank you&#x201d; to Conlon as she led her daughter toward the door. Voyager&#x2019;s chief engineer nodded knowingly, then bent to whisper something in Miral&#x2019;s ear.<br> <br>Turning back, Miral said, &#x201c;You look beautiful, Mommy.&#x201d;<br> <br>The compliment nearly undid Torres. &#x201c;Thank you, honey. I love you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Love you,&#x201d; Miral replied as she tugged Conlon out the door.<br> <br>Ten days before, it would have been Tom complimenting her appearance. Torres would have reveled in his words, knowing that her swelling belly truly was a thing of beauty to him. By now he was back on Earth, preparing to meet his mother in a series of court-ordered mediation sessions meant to determine their fitness as parents and the ultimate custody of Miral and her unborn brother.<br> <br>They had argued right before he left. The memory of it still stung, the only sign of life in an otherwise suddenly lonely heart. Not long before, Torres&#x2019;s life was near perfect. She hadn&#x2019;t seen it, of course. You never did until it was gone.<br> <br>Nothing fit anymore.<br> <br>With a Herculean force of will, Torres set these dispiriting thoughts aside, squared her shoulders, and departed for the shuttlebay.<br> <br><br> <br>Counselor Hugh Cambridge was due in Voyager&#x2019;s shuttlebay for transfer to the First World of the Confederacy of the Worlds of the First Quadrant. To arrive late was to court the displeasure of his commanding officer, Captain Chakotay, and the new fleet commander, Admiral Janeway.<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t care.<br> <br>The computer had alerted him to the Doctor&#x2019;s arrival on Voyager, and for the next few minutes, his duties could wait.<br> <br>Cambridge had learned days earlier that Seven was lost to him forever. It was possible he was transferring his understandable anger and disappointment with Seven onto the Doctor.<br> <br>But Cambridge didn&#x2019;t think so. The Doctor had been the prime mover in the series of events that had ended with Seven&#x2019;s departure from the fleet. The counselor did not make a habit of sharing personal matters with the rest of the crew. His position required a well-honed detachment. In this case, however, he had decided to make an exception. He owed the Doctor pain, and once he had fulfilled this obligation, his own was sure to diminish.<br> <br>He found the Doctor standing in his small office, conferring with a nurse. Though assigned to the Galen for the fleet&#x2019;s mission, the Doctor had been temporarily transferred to Voyager when Seven&#x2019;s CMO, Doctor Sharak, had been ordered to accompany her to Earth. Cambridge had not seen nor spoken to the Doctor in almost two months.<br> <br>As soon as the Doctor saw him, he immediately dismissed the nurse. The door had barely slid shut behind her before Cambridge said, &#x201c;You just couldn&#x2019;t help yourself, could you?&#x201d;<br> <br>The Doctor sighed dramatically. &#x201c;I missed you too, Counselor.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Seven explicitly requested that you keep all of your research into her catoms private. She told me about your little breakthrough before the Galen left to ferry Admiral Janeway back to Earth. She was astonished that you had successfully visualized a catom. But that brilliant discovery did not release you from your ethical duty to her as your patient and your friend.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Counselor&#x2014;&#x201d; the Doctor began.<br> <br>&#x201c;You had no right to share that breakthrough without her permission. But you had to, didn&#x2019;t you? You couldn&#x2019;t bear for your genius to remain hidden. You knew what they&#x2019;d do to her when they learned of her potential usefulness. But you didn&#x2019;t care.&#x201d;<br> <br>For a moment, the Doctor appeared stricken. Then, ever so briefly, a strange serenity descended over his features. He crossed to stand directly in front of Cambridge and raised a medical tricorder between them, directing it at the counselor.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; Cambridge demanded.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are clearly unwell, Couns...</p><h2>Unseen Forces: The Integration of Science, Reality and You</h2><p>Interactions with alternate realms, the dead, and non-human entities; out-of-body and near-death experiences; psychic and healing abilities; mystical and peak experiences and more have opened the door to unseen forces and questions about consciousness, life, and reality that science struggles to explain.This ground-breaking book, written by a neuroscientist and unbiased futuristic thinker, provides the answers and wakes you up to the meaning of life, reality and YOU.

Kate Stone was twenty when the war began, living with her widowed mother, five brothers, and younger sister at Brokenburn, their plantation home in northeastern Louisiana. When Grant moved against Vicksburg, the family fled before the invading armies, eventually found refuge in Texas, and finally returned to a devastated home. </p><p>Kate began her journal in May, 1861, and made regular entries up to November, 1865. She included briefer sketches in 1867 and 1868. In chronicling her everyday activities, Kate reveals much about a way of life that is no more: books read, plantation management and crops, maintaining slaves in the antebellum period, the attitude and conduct of slaves during the war, the fate of refugees, and civilian morale. Without pretense and with almost photographic clarity, she portrays the South during its darkest hours.</p></p><p><p>John Q.

But not from his brutal sport&#x2019;s enclosed rings. Orphaned and torn from his sisters as a boy, he has no family. That is, until he gets a letter revealing how much the once-little girls want him back in Harmony, Kentucky. <br> &nbsp;<br> To stop his sister from marrying a man as sleazy as he is wealthy, Dean finds himself teaming up with her pretty-but-smart-mouthed friend Eve&#x2014;who&#x2019;s heard of &#x201c;Havoc&#x2019;s&#x201d; reputation and doesn&#x2019;t need some hunk trampling on her heart. Now all Dean has to do is protect his sisters, win Eve over, and expose a devious criminal. And he thought winning the heavyweight cage fighting belt was hard...</p><p><b>Lori Foster</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author of many contemporary romances.Orphaned at nine, Dean "Havoc" Conor has grown into a tough-as-nails extreme fighter happy to live a solitary life. When he receives a letter from his two little sisters, who he hasn't seen in the twenty years since their parents died, Dean reluctantly decides to honor their request and return home to Harmony, Ky. Once there, he finds that the aunt who raised his sisters has squandered most of their inheritance and that one of his sisters, Cam, is engaged to a sleaze named Roger. He also meets Cam's best friend, Eve Lavon, an opinionated beauty who already has the commitment-phobic Dean figured out. However, if Dean's going to drive off Roger and figure out why someone in Harmony is trying to kill him, he'll need Eve's help&#x2014;and he'll have to confront his growing feelings for her. More interesting, though, is Dean's struggle to become the family man his sisters need, a transformation that Foster executes with skill, elevating the tight if typical romance plot with convincing, heartfelt family drama. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

More is demanded in this stage of the game than in any other, and the knowledge and imagination that saw you through the opening and middle game are just not enough to carry you through the end game also. You need a thorough knowledge of the principles of chess endings, and this book is an excellent introduction to those principles.<br>World-famous chess teacher Eugene Znosko-Borovsky clearly explains the importance of tempo, the rule of the triangle, the idea of related squares, the power of the pawn and king, and the versatility of the rook. Each piece is studied individually, and many common end game situations are considered. Drawing on games from such master players as Morphy, Marshall, Steinitz, Capablanca, Alekhine, Lasker, and Botvinnik, Znosko-Borovsky shows you how to think during the end game no matter what pieces you may have or what situation you may be in. Special consideration is given to the theory of positional play, the conception and execution of a plan, and the recognition of tactical opportunities.<br>Emphasis throughout the book is on understanding principles, rather than memorizing moves, with the result that the reader will be able to apply Znosko-Borovsky&#x2019;s techniques to almost any situation that may arise. The author&#x2019;s well-known clarity of exposition makes this book most useful to a beginner or intermediate player.</p><p>Eugene Alexandrovich Znosko-Borovsky was a Russian chess master, music and drama critic, teacher and author.

Jenny Boully&#x2019;s sentences have a similar effect on me. She comes by her slippages and seams honestly. One gets the sense that she has straddled the space between waking and dreaming, not writing and writing, her whole life, and has something real to tell you about the time she&#x2019;s spent in the in-between.

It is everything we could want, but not as we expect.&#x201d;&nbsp;<em><strong>&#x2014;Brevity</strong></em><br><br>&#x201c;[<em>Betwixt-and-Between</em>&nbsp;is] not only a powerful demonstration of writing as life, but of the ways that lived experiences can illuminate and transform writing.&#x201d;&nbsp;<em><strong>&#x2014;Star Tribune</strong></em><br><br>&#x201c;Boully&#x2019;s writing is a glimmering landscape, a series of more-true-than-true snapshots which capture what it means to exist simultaneously within and without the page&#x2014;a kind of existence that can only be shown through imagined loves, daydreams, moths, memories, hunger, outer space, and electronic bleeps.&#x201d;&nbsp;<em><strong>&#x2014;Arkansas International</strong></em><br><br>&#x201c;The writings of Jenny Boully occupy the space between genres and forms, eluding attempts to place them in one tradition or another.

In this new collection, Jenny Boully evokes knowledge&#x2019;s ephemeral core, how it looks in the air or as a meadow, her brilliance inflected with lyric witchery.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong>&#x2014;Carmen Gim�nez Smith</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Anybody can have a thought&#x2014;they cost nothing, on the internet&#x2014;but to capture the drama of someone thinking on the page is a rare and difficult thing. That&#x2019;s where the action of an essay is, and the intimacy too, and in Jenny Boully&#x2019;s latest collection we draw so near the mind of the maker we seem to fall down through ourselves, into a new and wholly strange concentration.&nbsp;<em>Betwixt-and-Between</em>&nbsp;leaves behind an accurate record of the trouble Boully encounters in her search for the simplest way to say complex things about sincerity and beauty and love and happiness&#x2014;and yes, all those shy hopes are here, all caught on the sly, in this wonder of a book.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong>&#x2014;Charles D&#x2019;Ambrosio</strong><br><br>&#x201c;[Boully] captures trains of thought like breezes through her fingers, which she has a rare gift for taming long enough to lie still and be regarded.&#x201d;&nbsp;<em><strong>&#x2014;NewCity<br></strong></em><br><strong>Praise for Jenny Boully:</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Jenny is the future of nonfiction in America.

There are many questions in this work that are left unanswered, as well as many silences surrounding what happened &#x2018;in the end.&#x2019; Yes, there is much talk about beginnings, but we are never truly situated &#x2018;in the beginning.&#x2019; Instead, we remain in the continual becoming of love and loss, memory and perception, narrative and poetry.

But they know.<br><br> They know.<br><br> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br><br> 20 July 2016, 2.05 a.m.<br><br> Canal Manor estate, Oxford<br><br> They say homebuyers make up their mind about a house within thirty seconds of going inside. Well, take it from me, the average police officer takes less than ten. In fact, most of us have come to judgement long before we're through the door. Only it's the people we're judging, not the property. So when we pull up outside 5 Barge Close, I have a pretty good idea what to expect. It's what used to be called an 'Executive Home'. Perhaps still is, for all I know. They have money, these people, but not as much as they'd like, or else they'd have bought a genuine Victorian house and not this reproduction version on a raw new estate the wrong side of the canal. It's the same red brick, the same bay windows, but the gardens are small and the garages huge - not so much fake as downright forgery.<br><br> The uniform posted at the front door tells me the family have already done the obligatory search of the house and garden. You'd be amazed how many times we find kids under beds or in wardrobes. They're not lost, they're just hiding. And most of those stories don't have happy endings either. But it seems that's not what we're dealing with here. As the Duty Inspector told me an hour ago when he woke me up, 'I know we wouldn't normally call you in this early, but this late at night, a kid that young, it feels all wrong. And the family were having a party so people had started looking for her long before they called us. I decided pissing you off was the least of our worries.' I'm not, actually. Pissed off, that is. And to be honest, I'd have done the same.<br><br> 'Out the back's a bombsite, I'm afraid, sir,' says the PC at the door. 'People must've been traipsing up and down all night. Bits of dead firework everywhere. Kids. Can't see forensics getting sod all out there, sir.'<br><br> Great, I think. Effing fantastic.<br><br> Gislingham rings the bell and we stand at the door, waiting. He's shifting nervously from one foot to the other. Doesn't matter how many times you do it, you never get used to it. And when you do, it's time to quit. I take a few last gasps of fag and look back round the close. Despite the fact that it's two in the morning, almost every house is glaring with light, and there are people at several of the upstairs windows. Two patrol cars are parked on the scrubby bike-tracked grass opposite, their lights throbbing, and a couple of tired PCs are trying to keep the rubberneckers at a decent distance. There are half a dozen other officers on doorsteps, talking to the neighbours. Then the front door opens and I swing round.<br><br> 'Mrs Mason?'<br><br> She's heavier than I'd expected. Jowls already forming and she can't be more than, what, mid-thirties? She has a cardigan on over a party dress - a halter-neck leopard-print job in a dull orangey colour that doesn't go with her hair. She glances down the street and then wraps the cardy tighter about herself. But it's hardly cold. It touched ninety today.<br><br> 'DI Adam Fawley, Mrs Mason. May we come in?'<br><br> 'Can you take your shoes off? The carpet's only just been cleaned.'<br><br> I've never understood why people buy cream carpet, especially if they have children, but it hardly seems the moment to argue. So we bend over like a couple of schoolkids, undoing our laces. Gislingham flashes me a look: there are hooks by the door labelled with the family's names, and their shoes are lined up by the mat. By size. And colour. Jesus.<br><br> Odd, though, what exposing your feet does to your brain. Padding about in socks makes me feel like an amateur. It's not a good start.<br><br> The sitting room has an archway through to a kitchen with a breakfast bar. There are some women in there, whispering, fussing about the kettle, their party make-up bleak in the unflinching neon light. The family are perched on the edge of a sofa far too big for the space. Barry Mason, Sharon and the boy, Leo. The kid stares at the floor, Sharon stares at me, Barry's all over the place. He's got up like the identikit hipster dad - cargo pants, slightly too spiky hair, slightly too garish floral shirt not tucked in - but if the look is landlocked at thirty-five, I'm guessing from the grey he's actually a good ten years older than his wife. Who evidently buys the trousers in this house.<br><br> You get all sorts of emotions when a kid goes missing. Anger, panic, denial, guilt. I've seen them all, alone and in combination. But there's a look on Barry Mason's face I've not seen before. A look I can't define. As for Sharon, her fists are clenched so rigid her knuckles are white.<br><br> I sit down. Gislingham doesn't. I think he's worried the furniture might not take his weight. He eases his shirt collar away from his neck, hoping no one notices.<br><br> 'Mrs Mason, Mr Mason,' I begin. 'I understand this must be a difficult time, but it's vital we gather as much information as we can. I'm sure you know this already, but the first few hours really are crucial - the more we know, the more likely it'll be that we find Daisy safe and well.'<br><br> Sharon Mason pulls at a loose thread on her cardigan. 'I'm not sure what else we can tell you - we already spoke to that other officer - '<br><br> 'I know, but perhaps you can just talk me through it again. You said Daisy was at school today as usual and after that she was here in the house until the party started - she didn't go out to play?'<br><br> 'No. She was in her bedroom upstairs.'<br><br> 'And the party - can you tell me who came?'<br><br> Sharon glances at her husband, then at me. 'People from the close. The children's classmates. Their parents.'<br><br> Her kids' friends then. Not hers. Or theirs.<br><br> 'So, what - forty people? Would that be fair?'<br><br> She frowns. 'Not so many. I have a list.'<br><br> 'That would be very helpful - if you could give it to DC Gislingham.'<br><br> Gislingham looks up briefly from his notebook.<br><br> 'And you last saw Daisy when exactly?'<br><br> Barry Mason still hasn't said anything. I'm not even sure if he heard me. I turn to him. He's got a toy dog in his hands and keeps twisting it. It's distress, I know, but it looks unnervingly like he's wringing its neck.<br><br> 'Mr Mason?'<br><br> He blinks. 'I dunno,' he says dully. 'Elevenish maybe? It was all a bit confused. Busy. You know, lots of people.'<br><br> 'But it was midnight when you realized she was missing.'<br><br> 'We decided it was time the kids went to bed. People were starting to leave. But we couldn't find her. We looked everywhere. We called everyone we could think of. My little girl - my beautiful little girl - '<br><br> He starts to cry. I still find that hard to handle, even now. When men weep.<br><br> I turn to Sharon. 'Mrs Mason? What about you? When did you last see your daughter? Was it before or after the fireworks?'<br><br> Sharon shivers suddenly. 'Before, I think.'<br><br> 'And the fireworks started when?'<br><br> 'Ten. As soon as it got dark. We didn't want them going on too late. You can get in trouble. They can report you to the council.'<br><br> 'So you last saw Daisy before that. Was it in the garden or in the house?'<br><br> She hesitates, frowning. 'In the garden. She was running about all night. Quite the belle of the ball.'<br><br> I wonder, in passing, how long it is since I've heard anyone use that phrase. 'So Daisy was in good spirits - nothing worrying her, as far as you knew?'<br><br> 'No, nothing. She was having a lovely time. Laughing. Dancing to the music. What girls do.'<br><br> I glance at the brother, interested in his reaction. But there is none. He is sitting remarkably still. Considering.<br><br> 'When did you last see Daisy, Leo?'<br><br> He shrugs. He doesn't know. 'I was watching the fireworks.'<br><br> I smile at him. 'Do you like fireworks?'<br><br> He nods, not quite meeting my eye.<br><br> 'You know what? So do I.'<br><br> He glances up and there's a little flutter of connection, but then his head drops again and he starts pushing one foot across the rug, making circles in the shagpile. Sharon reaches out and taps him on the leg. He stops.<br><br> I turn to Barry again. 'And the side gate to the garden was open, I believe.'<br><br> Barry Mason sits back, suddenly defensive. He sniffs loudly and wipes his hand across his nose. 'Well, you can't be up and down opening the door every five minutes, can you? It was easier to have people come in that way. Less mess in the house.' He glances at his wife.<br><br> I nod. 'Of course. I see the garden backs on to the canal. Do you have a gate on to the towpath?'<br><br> Barry Mason shakes his head. 'Fat chance - council won't let you. There's no way he got in that way.'<br><br> 'He?'<br><br> He looks away again. 'Whoever it was. The bastard who took her. The bastard who took my Daisy.'<br><br> I write 'my' on my notepad and put a question mark next to it. 'But you didn't actually see a man?'<br><br> He takes a deep breath that breaks into a sob, and he looks away, tears starting again. 'No. I didn't see anyone.'<br><br> I shuffle through my papers. 'I have the photo of Daisy you gave Sergeant Davis. Can you tell me what she was wearing?'<br><br> There's a pause.<br><br> 'It was fancy dress,' says Sharon eventually. 'For the children. We thought that would be nice. Daisy was dressed as her name.'<br><br> 'I'm sorry, I'm not with you - '<br><br> 'A daisy. She was dressed as a daisy.'<br><br> I sense Gislingham's reaction, but don't allow myself to look at him. 'I see. So that was - '<br><br> 'A green skirt, green tights and shoes. And a headdress with white petals and a yellow centre. We got it from that shop on Fontover Street. It cost a fortune, even just to hire it. And we had to leave a deposit.'<br><br> Her voice falters. She gasps, then clenches her hand into a fist and pushes it against her mouth, her shoulders shaking. Barry Mason reaches across and puts an arm round his wife. She's whimpering, rocking backwards and forwards, telling him it's not her fault, that she didn't know, and he starts to stroke her hair.<br><br> There's another silence, then suddenly Leo edges forward and slips off the sofa. All his clothes seem slightly too big for him; you can barely see his hands for his sleeves. He comes over to me and gives me his phone. It's showing a still from a video. A still of Daisy in her green skirt. She's a beautiful child, no doubt about that. I press Play and watch for about fifteen seconds as she dances for the camera. She's brimming with confidence and exuberance - it radiates off her even on a two-inch screen. When the video stops, I check the tag - it's only three days old. Our first piece of luck. We don't always get something as up to date as this.<br><br> 'Thank you, Leo.' I look up at Sharon Mason, who's now blowing her nose. 'Mrs Mason, if I give you my mobile number can you send this to me?'<br><br> She waves her hands helplessly. 'Oh, I'm hopeless with those things. Leo can do it.'<br><br> I glance at him and he nods. His fringe is a bit too long, but he doesn't seem to mind it in his eyes. They're dark, his eyes. Like his hair.<br><br> 'Thanks, Leo. You must be good with phones for someone your age. How old are you?'<br><br> He blushes, just a little. 'Ten.'<br><br> I turn to Barry Mason. 'Did Daisy have her own computer?'<br><br> 'No way. The things you hear about with kids online these days. I let her use my PC sometimes as long as I'm in the room with her.'<br><br> 'So no email?'<br><br> 'No.'<br><br> 'What about a mobile?'<br><br> This time it's Sharon who answers. 'We thought she was too young. I said she could have one for Christmas. She'll be nine by then.'<br><br> So that's one less chance of tracking her down. But this I do not say. 'Did you see anyone with Daisy last night, Leo?'<br><br> He starts, then shakes his head.<br><br> 'Or before that - was there anyone hanging around? Anyone you saw going to or from school?'<br><br> 'I drive them to school,' says Sharon sharply. As if that settles it.<br><br> And then the doorbell rings. Gislingham flips his notebook shut. 'That'll be SOCO. Or whatever we're supposed to call them now.'<br><br> Sharon looks at her husband, bewildered. 'He means forensics,' says Barry.<br><br> Sharon turns to me. 'What are they here for? We haven't done anything.'<br><br> 'I know that, Mrs Mason. Please don't be alarmed. It's standard procedure in a - when a child goes missing.'<br><br> Gislingham opens the front door and lets them in. I recognize Alan Challow straight away. He started on the job a few months after I did. Hasn't aged that well. Too little on top, too much round the waist. But he's good. He's good.<br><br> He nods to me. We don't need the pleasantries. 'Holroyd's just getting the kit from the car,' he says briskly. His paper suit is creaking. It's going to be hell in that thing when the sun comes up.<br><br> 'We'll go upstairs first,' he says, pulling on his gloves. 'Then start outside as soon as it's light. No press yet, I see. Praise be for small mercies.'<br><br> Sharon Mason has got unsteadily to her feet. 'I don't want you poking about in her room - touching her things - treating us like criminals - '<br><br> 'It's not a full forensic search, Mrs Mason - we won't be making any mess. We don't even need to go into her room. We just need to take her toothbrush.'<br><br>Because it&#x2019;s the best source for DNA. Because we might need that to match to her body. But this, again, I do not say.<br><br> &#x2018;We will be making a more extensive search in the garden, in case her abductor has left any physical evidence that might help us identify him. I trust we have your agreement to do that?&#x2019;<br><br> Barry Mason nods, then reaches up and touches his wife&#x2019;s elbow. &#x2018;Best we just let them do their job, eh?&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;And we&#x2019;ll be arranging for a Family Liaison Officer to attend as soon as possible.&#x2019;<br><br> Sharon turns to me. &#x2018;What do you mean, <i>attend</i>?&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;They&#x2019;ll be here to make sure you&#x2019;re kept informed as soon as we get any news, and to be on hand in case you need anything.&#x2019;<br><br> Sharon frowns. &#x2018;What here? In the <i>house</i>?&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Yes, if that&#x2019;s OK with you. They&#x2019;re fully trained &#x2013; there&#x2019;s nothing to worry about, they won&#x2019;t be at all intrusive &#x2013; &#x2019;<br><br> But she&#x2019;s already shaking her head. &#x2018;No. I don&#x2019;t want anyone here. I don&#x2019;t want you people spying on us. Is that clear?&#x2019; <br><br> I glance at Gislingham, who gives a minute shrug.<br><br> I take a deep breath. &#x2018;That is, of course, your right. We will designate a member of our team to be your point of contact, and if you change your mind &#x2013; &#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;No,&#x2019; she says quickly. &#x2018;We won&#x2019;t.&#x2019;</p><h2>The Heiress (The Madison Sisters, 2)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t help but fall in love with Lynsay Sands!&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Christina Dodd</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whether she&#x2019;s enthralling readers with the exploits of her Argeneau vampire family, transporting fans to the Scottish Highlands, or enchanting them with love affairs of the noble lords and ladies of the Regency <em>ton, New York Times</em> and <em>USA Today</em> bestseller Lynsay Sands knows how to pen a winner! <em>The Heiress</em>&#x2014;the second book in the very sexy, very funny Regency romance series she began with <em>The Countess</em>&#x2014;is further proof of Sands&#x2019;s historical romance mastery.

We discover that in 1536 Henry met many failures - physical, personal, and political - and emerged from them a revolutionary new king who proceeded to transform a nation and reform a religion. A compelling story, the effects of which are still with us today, 1536 shows what a profound difference can be made merely by changing the heart of a king.</p><p>Suzannah Lipscomb is Research Curator at Hampton Court Palace.

Seen in an anthropological perspective <em>Leviticus</em> has a mystical structure which plots the book into three parts corresponding to the three parts of the desert tabernacle, both corresponding to the parts of Mount Sinai. This completely new reading transforms the interpretation of the purity laws. The pig and other forbidden animals are not abhorrent, they command the same respect due to all God's creatures. Boldly challenging several traditions of Bible criticism, Mary Douglas claims that Leviticus is not the narrow doctrine of a crabbed professional priesthood but a powerful intellectual statement about a modern religion which emphasizes God's justice and compassion.<br></p><p>Mary Douglas is also the author of In the Wilderness, the Doctrine of Defilement in the Book of Numbers (1993)`A rich and stimulating work'<br>International Review of Biblical Studies, vol.46 1999/2000<br><br>`well-produced ... stylishly constructed ...

These materials gently develop concepts, and the practice of those concepts is extended over a considerable period of time. This is called &#34;incremental development and continual review.&#34; Material is introduced in easily understandable pieces (increments), allowing students to grasp one facet of a concept before the next one is introduced. Both facets are then practiced together until another one is introduced. This feature is combined with continual review in every lesson throughout the year. Topics are never dropped but are increased in complexity and practiced every day, providing the time required for concepts to become totally familiar. Algebra 1/2, third edition is made up of five instructional components: Introduction of the New Increment, Examples with Complete Solutions, Practice of the Increment, Daily Problem Set, and Cumulative Tests. Algebra 1/2 covers all topics normally taught in pre-algebra, as well as additional topics from geometry and discrete mathematics. It is recommended for seventh-graders who plan to take first-year algebra in the eighth grade, or for eighth-graders who plan to take first-year algebra in the ninth grade. Algebra 1/2 represents the culmination of the study of pre-algebra mathematics. This set contains a student text, answer key and test forms. A solutions manual is available separately.

Each of these resources has strengths but also weaknesses. In <i>Calculus Simplified</i>, Oscar Fernandez combines the strengths and omits the weaknesses, resulting in a &#x201c;Goldilocks approach&#x201d; to learning calculus: just the right level of detail, the right depth of insights, and the flexibility to customize your calculus adventure.</p><p>Fernandez begins by offering an intuitive introduction to the three key ideas in calculus&#x2015;limits, derivatives, and integrals. The mathematical details of each of these pillars of calculus are then covered in subsequent chapters, which are organized into mini-lessons on topics found in a college-level calculus course. Each mini-lesson focuses first on developing the intuition behind calculus and then on conceptual and computational mastery. Nearly 200 solved examples and more than 300 exercises allow for ample opportunities to practice calculus. And additional resources&#x2015;including video tutorials and interactive graphs&#x2015;are available on the book&#x2019;s website.</p><p><i>Calculus Simplified</i> also gives you the option of personalizing your calculus journey. For example, you can learn all of calculus with zero knowledge of exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions&#x2015;these are discussed at the end of each mini-lesson. You can also opt for a more in-depth understanding of topics&#x2015;chapter appendices provide additional insights and detail. Finally, an additional appendix explores more in-depth real-world applications of calculus.</p><p>Learning calculus should be an exciting voyage, not a daunting task. <i>Calculus Simplified </i>gives you the freedom to choose your calculus experience, and the right support to help you conquer the subject with confidence.</p><p>� An accessible, intuitive introduction to first-semester calculus</p><p>� Nearly 200 solved problems and more than 300 exercises (all with answers)</p><p>� No prior knowledge of exponential, logarithmic, or trigonometric functions required</p><p>� Additional online resources&#x2015;video tutorials and supplementary exercises&#x2015;provided</p></p><p><b>Oscar E.

The book's detailed coverage explores the market and political allocation and management of natural resources for human benefits, as well as their contributions for environmental services. Wise natural resource policies that promote sustainable development, not senseless exploitation, promise to improve our quality of life and the environment.<p> Public or private policies may be used to manage natural resources. When private markets are inadequate due to public goods or market failure, many policy options, including regulations, education, incentives, government ownership, and hybrid public/private policy instruments may be crafted by policy makers.

The book guides us from the birth of the mechanized view of the world in Isaac Newton&#39;s Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy in which mathematics becomes the ultimate tool for modelling physical reality, to the dawn of a radically new and often counter-intuitive age in Albert Einstein&#39;s Special Theory of Relativity in which it is the mathematical model which suggests new aspects of that reality. The development of this process is discussed from the modern viewpoint of differential forms. Using this concept, the student learns to compute orbits and rocket trajectories, model flows and force fields, and derive the laws of electricity and magnetism. These exercises and observations of mathematical symmetry enable the student to better understand the interaction of physics and mathematics.</p><p>The subtitle of this book, ``From celestial mechanics to special relativity&#39;&#39; is correctly indicative of its content, and in the preface, the author enthusiastically pleads guilty to blurring the line between mathematics and physics. One of the book&#39;s merits is the substantive historical material given. Among other purposes this serves to show the physics setting in which many calculus concepts have their origin. The book eventually gets around to a fairly honest mathematical treatment of the traditional material of advanced calculus via differential forms, but before arriving at this in Chapter 5, mathematics students are likely to have some frustrating experiences. In Chapter 4 one encounters ``we define $\int\sp{bar b}\sb{bar a}f\sb 1(x,y,z)dx+f\sb 2(x,y,z)dy+f\sb 3(x,y,z)dz$ to be the work done by this force field as it moves a particle along the directed line segment from $bar a$ to $bar b$&#39;&#39;. Exercise 8 at the end of this section states ``Prove that in an arbitrary force field the amount of work done in moving from $bar a$ to $bar b$ may be dependent on the path&#39;&#39;. So, one asks oneself, how is {\it work} defined? Nothing more is to be found than the statement in Chapter 2 that work is force times distance, and the resulting representation as a dot product of vectors. The book has much to recommend it. If the first four chapters are primarily to serve as providing some intuitive foundation, it might be better to more explicitly acknowledge this, and to find a more appropriate formulation for whatever is intended in exercises such as the one cited above.

It includes revised versions of earlier papers, and also much original material.</p><p>Harry Guntrip (1901-1975) was a psychologist known for his major contributions to object relations theory. He was a Fellow of the British Psychological Society and a psychotherapist and lecturer at the Department of Psychiatry, Leeds University, and also a Congregationalist minister. He was described by John D. Sutherland as &#34;one of the psychoanalytic immortals&#34;.In Part 1, a description of the schizoid position is given, in terms of relation to the external world, internal states of ego disintegration and, the core of the problem, the dissociated and lost emotional heart of the total self.Part 2 reviews the theoretical development which makes it necessary to see manic-depressive problems in the light of the deeper and more subtle schizoid condition. Part 3, on &#34;The Nature of Basic Ego-Weakness&#34;, seeks to assess fully the importance of Winnicott&#39;s research into the earliest beginnings of ego development, as the infant slowly grows into psychic separation from the mother, a process that involves both the opportunity for individuation and also the risk of loss of relationship, as well as the risk of possibly permanent stunting of the ego development instead of growth of basic ego relatedness in the mentally healthy person.Part 4 explores the implications for psychotherapy of the study of the schizoid problem, particularly in the matter of the personal therapeutic relationship of therapist and patient. And finally, in Part 5, the review of theory is put on a broad foundation with a chapter on &#34;The Concept of Psychodynamic Science&#34; and another comparing the ego theories of Hartmann and the &#34;object-relational&#34; thinkers, Melanie Klein, Fairbairn, and Winnicott.</p><h2>HDEV (with MindTap, 1 term Printed Access Card) (Packaging May Vary)</h2><p>Learn Life-Span Development YOUR Way with HDEV!

In the 1980s, rural China gained the upper hand, and the result was rapid as well as broad-based growth. In the 1990s, urban China triumphed. In the 1990s, the Chinese state reversed many of its productive rural experiments, with long-lasting damage to the economy and society. A weak financial sector, income disparity, rising illiteracy, productivity slowdowns, and reduced personal income growth are the product of the capitalism with Chinese characteristics of the 1990s and beyond. While GDP grew quickly in both decades, the welfare implications of growth differed substantially. The book uses the emerging Indian miracle to debunk the widespread notion that democracy is automatically anti-growth. The single biggest obstacle to sustainable growth and financial stability in China today is its poor political governance. As the country marks its 30th anniversary of reforms in 2008, China faces some of its toughest economic challenges and substantial vulnerabilities that require fundamental institutional reforms.</p><p>This book presents a story of two Chinas - an entrepreneurial rural China and a state-controlled urban China.

In the face of pervasive racial inequality and segregation, most whites cannot answer that question. Robin DiAngelo argues that a number of factors make this question difficult for whites miseducation about what racism is; ideologies such as individualism and colorblindness; defensiveness; and a need to protect (rather than expand) our worldviews. These factors contribute to what she terms white racial illiteracy. Speaking as a white person to other white people, Dr. DiAngelo clearly and compellingly takes readers through an analysis of white socialization. She describes how race shapes the lives of white people, explains what makes racism so hard for whites to see, identifies common white racial patterns, and speaks back to popular white narratives that work to deny racism. Written as an accessible introduction to white identity from an anti-racist framework, <i>What Does It Mean To Be White?</i> is an invaluable resource for members of diversity and anti-racism programs and study groups and students of sociology, psychology, education, and other disciplines.</p><p>Robin DiAngelo is a faculty member in the Department of Education at Westfield State University in Massachusetts. Her research is in whiteness studies and discourse analysis. She is concerned with the challenges of an increasingly white teaching force and an increasingly diverse student population. Her articles have appeared in the <i>Journal of Understanding and Dismantling Privilege, International Journal of Critical Pedagogy,</i> and <i>Equity &amp; Excellence in Education.</i> She has twice been honored with the Student's Choice Award for Educator of the Year. She has provided diversity and anti-racism training for a wide range of organizations, including the City of Seattle.�Rarely will one find an analysis of whiteness (and the problems associated with it) that is as comprehensive as this one. From incisive and wide-ranging critiques of how white folks deflect, deny, and evade the topic of racism, and the implications of our own racial identity and position, to an absolutely on-point interrogation of how racism and whiteness influence white teachers-in-training, and thus, the larger educational process, Robin DiAngelo demonstrates the kind of clarity of thought so needed on this important subject.� (Tim Wise, Author of &#x2018;White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son&#x2019; and &#x2018; Dear White America: Letter to a New Minority&#x2019;)<br> �This book goes well beyond Diversity Training 101. It is filled with comprehensive knowledge and useful tools for understanding racism and white people&#x2019;s role in it. An invaluable resource for every educator, student, practitioner, and concerned citizen; you will be better prepared to address all forms of oppression after reading this book.� (Eddie Moore, Founder of The White Privilege Conference)<br> �With directness, sensitivity, and clarity, Robin DiAngelo leads the reader through a series of challenging and revelatory discussions that have profound implications for teaching and learning in today's classrooms. Her question, &#x2018;What does it mean to be white?&#x2019;, underscores the pressing need for honest dialogue, particularly among white educators, about this tremendously important topic.

As a first-hand account of the horrors of slavery, it was a vital part of the campaign to end that "accursed trade," but the book is far more than merely a political pamphlet.

This book serves as a basic primer for the beginning researcher and as a useful reference and guide for experienced researchers who wish to re-examine their own skills and abilities in light of best practices of participant observation.</p><p>Kathleen M. DeWalt is professor of anthropology and public health and director of the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Pittsburgh. Billie R. DeWalt is a past director of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh.Participant observation lies at the heart of the ethnographic approach to qualitative research. The essence of participant observation is immersion in the settings, the cultural practices and daily activities of people who are the focus of study. Through participant observation, we researchers form relationships with people who teach us to see the world through their eyes. The translation of everyday experience and knowledge acquisition in the field into the rigorous conduct of participation is rare in the world of qualitative inquiry. In this valuable and easy to understand publication, DeWalt and DeWalt, two widely recognized and internationally ethnographers pool their knowledge to offer a comprehensive and structured approach to participant observation that is 'must' reading for initiates and experienced researchers alike. (Jean J. Schensul, Institute for Community Research)<br><br>This excellent book (1st ed., 2002) about the use of participant observation in anthropological field research goes appreciably beyond this specific topic. In very accessible prose, Kathleen DeWalt (anthropology, Univ. of Pittsburgh) and Billie DeWalt (formerly, director, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Pittsburgh) cover in some detail the many aspects of participant observation: its essential nature to the enterprise of anthropology and the preparation for and potential pitfalls of using this approach. The authors also present concepts not strictly associated with participant observation, like validity and reliability, elements of research design, online research, and a strong chapter on data management. In addition, there is discussion of computer indexing and coding, informed consent, and the legal status of anthropological research with reference to who owns field notes and the potential for the subpoena of those notes and the researcher. The authors systematize and demystify note taking and include an appendix with examples of field notes from three projects. There are many apt examples throughout that elucidate the points made. The expansive and timely bibliography is of particular note. An excellent basic methodological reference work for undergraduate and graduate students as well as professionals. Summing Up: Essential.

Psychologist Jennifer Freyd&#39;s breakthrough theory explaining this phenomenon shows how psychogenic amnesia not only happens but, if the abuse occurred at the hands of a parent or caregiver, is often necessary for survival. Freyd&#39;s book will give embattled professionals, beleaguered abuse survivors, and the confused public a new, clear understanding of the lifelong effects and treatment of child abuse.</p><p>Jennifer J. Freyd understands the operation of memory in both professional and personal terms. As an academic psychologist, Professor Freyd has researched the psychological processes of memory and the physiological operation of the mind. In <i>Betrayal Trauma</i>, she uses the generally accepted findings of cognitive science to formulate a psychological theory of recovered memory. But Jennifer J. Freyd's interests and involvement in the study of recovered memories is not strictly academic. During her research, Freyd "uncovered" her own memories of childhood abuse. Her parents, who vehemently denied her allegations, have helped found an organization to support others "falsely accused" by individuals with "recovered memories" of abuse. Freyd's personal stake in the subject matter ironically causes her to go the extra mile in maintaining professional objectivity. While partisan detractors of other stripes will likely disagree, most of Freyd's well-written study sticks to the scientific processes that could supply an explanatory basis for forgetting and remembering traumatic experiences. Freyd mostly eschews victimology. She even considers how artificial memories could be the result of bad psychotherapy. <i>Betrayal Trauma</i> outlines a compelling thesis of how memory operates that addresses a controversial topic with great aplomb.Jennifer Freyd rises above the tawdry shoot-outs of polemic theorists by discarding the arguments that recollections of trauma must be true or false (they can be either and even both). Instead, she explores the logical mechanisms for not knowing: the many faces of knowledge isolation. No wonder, then, that sexual misuse by a trusted caregiver emerges as the most profound yet least remembered of all the possible hardships of childhood. This is a groundbreaking book that reflects clear thinking, cogent research, and profound scholarship.</p><h2>ECON MACRO (with MindTap Printed Access Card) (New, Engaging Titles from 4LTR Press)</h2><p>Learn Macroeconomics YOUR Way with ECON MACRO!

Was it ultimately to painting&#x2019;s advantage that in an age of orthodoxy and enforced censorship&#x2015;threats of hellfire, burnings at the stake&#x2015;artists found ways to reflect on the powers and limitations of religion without putting their thoughts into words?

In this magnum opus, Christian ethicist Glen Stassen argues that such robust Christianity stems from believing in a &#34;thicker&#34; Jesus, who is Lord over the whole of life and not just one compartment of it. Belief in this thicker Jesus results in &#34;incarnational discipleship&#34; and can help Christians deal with the challenges of what Charles Taylor has identified as a secular age. Stassen elegantly weaves the characteristics of incarnational discipleship as correctives to secularism.</p><p><b>Glen H. Stassen</b> is the Lewis B.

My parents were both native New Yorkers and I lived in NYC for 20 years, and nearby the rest of the time. I never thought I&#39;d write about Bryant Park, per se, but my father and mother bought a tiny apartment there way back when it was called Needle Park. Over the decades, I spend hundreds of hours there with my father, particularly as his health waned. I was writing these stories as my father was dying, and the park kept showing up, unbidden, in the background. I decided, finally, to let it be what it wanted to be, and I succumbed to the park and let it in everywhere. My father got to read at least 3 of these stories before he died.N.

It is a purely instrumental composition, both hopeful and romantic in feeling. The restrained mood and thematic economy of the symphony make it one of the least extravagant of the composer's works; it is also one of the most enjoyable.<br>Despite the lack of a "program" for the 7th, some critics profess to find that "a good case can be made out for the symphony as a whole having been consciously built round the poetic idea of nocturnal nature, progressing through various shades of darkness" (<i>New Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians</i>). Now musicians and music lovers can make their own determination by studying this inexpensive edition of the complete score, reprinted from the authoritative German edition of 1909.</p><p></p></p><p>Austrian composer and conductor Gustav Mahler (1860&#x2013;1911) wrote chiefly symphonies and <i>Lieder. </i>Late Romantic in style, his tempestuous works reflect the anxious mood of Europe at the turn of the 20th century. Because of his Jewish roots, the composer's&nbsp;music was suppressed by the Nazis but has enjoyed a steady revival over the past five decades.</p><h2>Publish and Perish: Three Tales of Tenure and Terror</h2><p><p><b>A <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year</b><br><b>A <i>Publisher's Weekly</i> Best Book of the Year</b></p><p>Combining the wit of David Lodge with Poe's delicious sense of the macabre, these are three witty, spooky novellas of satire set in academia&#x2015;a world where Derrida rules, love is a "complicated ideological position," and poetic justice is served with an ideological twist.</p></p><p>A typical line from <i>Publish and Perish</i> is the final thought of a character who's about to die in an oh-so-dreadful fashion: "This can't be happening to me. I've got tenure." Horror and humor together are always delightful, but rarely is the combination executed with such gleeful panache as in the three novellas that make up <i>Publish and Perish</i>. The humor is at the expense of American academics, from struggling postdocs to crusty full professors. The characters spout silly jargon, wrestle with their writing problems, preen their tender egos, and skewer their colleagues. Most are likeable: their vanity is so human, it's almost touching. But the horror isn't played for laughs; it's ruthless and chilling, in the tradition of Edgar A. Poe and M. R. James. As one <i>New York Times</i> reviewer writes, "<i>Publish and Perish</i> is an odd and exhilarating experience--the playfulness of post-modernism at its best somehow celebrating the urgent, earnest suspense of old-fashioned, cliff-hanging narrative."Three witty, spooky novellas of satire set in academia--a world where Derrida rules, love is a "complicated ideological position," and poetic justice is served with a supernatural twist. In "Queen of the Jungle," young academics Paul and Elizabeth appear to enjoy a comfortable, tenure-track marriage, commuting between their jobs on either side of the Midwest. When Paul begins an affair with Kymberly, a graduate student, Elizabeth's cat Charlotte deviously arranges revenge for her absent owner and teaches Paul a lesson about infidelity that can't be learned at any university. "99" is the story of Gregory Eyck, a cultural anthropologist whose conference on the death of Captain Cook fails miserably and threatens his career. Eyck accepts an assignment in England with the BBC and travels to a mysterious town near Stonehenge where he finds himself an unwitting participant/observer in a bizarre pagan ritual. And in "Casting the Runes," a junior history professor named Virginia Dunning finds that she must defend not only her postmodernist ideology but also her very life from the greed and sorcery of an older, senior professor. The academic satire of Jane Smiley and David Lodge seasoned with pinches of Poe, M. R. James, and Stephen King, <i>Publish and Perish</i> is stylish, unsettling, and funny on every page.</p><h2>Death in St. Petersburg: A Lady Emily Mystery (Lady Emily Mysteries, 12)</h2><p>"Alexander is at the top her game...(her) impeccable research and smart storytelling keep readers on the edge of their seats...A gripping tale by a grand mistress of the genre." -RT Book Reviews (Top Pick)<br><b></b><br><b>From <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Tasha Alexander comes the latest installment in the Lady Emily series. <i>Death in St. Petersburg</i> is a gripping new tale that will mesmerize fans of historical fiction and classic mysteries alike.</b><br><br>After the final curtain of Swan Lake, an animated crowd exits the Mariinsky theatre brimming with excitement from the night's performance. But outside the scene is somber. A ballerina's body lies face down in the snow, blood splattered like rose petals over the costume of the Swan Queen. The crowd is silenced by a single cry&#x2015; "Nemetseva is dead!"<br>Amongst the theatergoers is Lady Emily, accompanying her dashing husband Colin in Russia on assignment from the Crown. But it soon becomes clear that Colin isn't the only one with work to do. When the dead ballerina's aristocratic lover comes begging for justice, Emily must apply her own set of skills to discover the rising star's murderer. Her investigation takes her on a dance across the stage of Tsarist Russia, from the opulence of the Winter Palace, to the modest flats of ex-ballerinas and the locked attics of political radicals. A mysterious dancer in white follows closely behind, making waves through St. Petersburg with her surprise performances and trail of red scarves. Is it the sweet Katenka, Nemetseva's childhood friend and favorite rival? The ghost of the murdered �toile herself? Or, something even more sinister?</p><p><b>Tasha Alexander </b>is the author of the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling Lady Emily mystery series (<i>Tears of Pearl, Dangerous to Know, </i>and <i>A Crimson Warning</i>). The daughter of two philosophy professors, she studied English Literature and Medieval History at the University of Notre Dame. She and her husband, novelist Andrew Grant, live on a ranch in southeastern Wyoming."This latest in the Lady Emily series is a delight, combining the magic of tsarist St Petersburg with intimate knowledge of the world of ballet and complex plotting. Quirky characters, from the ghostly ballerina to the unrepentant&nbsp;jewel thief, offset the macabre murder and the political issues. A well-researched book written with style and flair." -The Historical Novels Review<br><br>"Alexander paints such a dazzling portrait of St. Petersburg and ballet at the turn of the twentieth century, that I would not even have dared ask for more, and yet the mystery is as brilliant as the vibrant images she presents...(her) knowledge of Imperial Russia, its culture and history, and ballet is beyond compare, down to the most minute but significant details, such as a perfect mastery of patronymics and diminutives used as terms of&nbsp;endearment, particular to Russian. I doubt having ever read a novel in which historical accuracy was so delightfully part of a strong murder mystery..." - Fresh Fiction<br><br>"...an exceptionally well-written novel. Ms. Alexander continues to reward her readers with a strong, solid, female lead and her dedication to historical accuracy has not diminished across this series. In this book, in particular,&nbsp;the city of St. Petersburg takes on a character of its own, simultaneously light and dark, both vibrant and foreboding. The mystery of the murdered ballerina is well crafted, with sufficient twists and turns to challenge even the&nbsp;most erudite reader." -Gumshoe Review</p><h2>Rose: My Life in Service to Lady Astor</h2><p>In 1928, Rosina Harrison arrived at the illustrious household of the Astor family to take up her new position as personal maid to the infamously temperamental Lady Nancy Astor, who sat in Parliament, entertained royalty, and traveled the world. "She's not a lady as you would understand a lady" was the butler's ominous warning. But what no one expected was that the iron-willed Lady Astor was about to meet her match in the no-nonsense, whip-smart girl from the country.<br><br>For 35 years, from the parties thrown for royalty and trips across the globe, to the air raids during WWII, Rose was by Lady Astor's side and behind the scenes, keeping everything running smoothly. In charge of everything from the clothes and furs to the baggage to the priceless diamond "sparklers," Rose was closer to Lady Astor than anyone else. In her decades of service she received one �5 raise, but she traveled the world in style and retired with a lifetime's worth of stories. Like Gosford Park and Downton Abbey, ROSE is a captivating insight into the great wealth 'upstairs' and the endless work 'downstairs', but it is also the story of an unlikely decades-long friendship that grew between Her Ladyship and her spirited Yorkshire maid.<p></p></p><p><b>Rosina Harrison</b> (1899-1989) served as Lady Nancy Astor's personal maid for over thirty-five years and was the author of two books.&nbsp;"An extraordinary document, realistic, candid, and a rare look from the vantage point below stairs at a nostalgically romanticized world." &#x2014; <b><i>Los Angeles Times</i></b><br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;A delectable assortment of tales and details about the habits of overprivileged Britishers and the people who served them....

But, in her eyes, that made her special; the devout LDS home she grew up in was filled with love, spirituality, and an emphasis on service. With Marie Osmond as her celebrity role model and plenty of Sunday School teachers to fill in the rest of the details, Joanna felt warmly embraced by the community that was such an integral part of her family. But as she grew older, Joanna began to wrestle with some tenets of her religion, including the Church&#x2019;s stance on women&#x2019;s rights and homosexuality. In 1993, when the Church excommunicated a group of feminists for speaking out about an LDS controversy, Joanna found herself searching for a way to live by the leadings of her heart and the faith she loved. <br><br><i>The Book of Mormon Girl</i> is a story about leaving behind the innocence of childhood belief and embracing the complications and heartbreaks that come to every adult life of faith. Joanna&#x2019;s journey through her faith explores a side of the religion that is rarely put on display: its humanity, its tenderness, its humor, its internal struggles. In Joanna&#x2019;s hands, the everyday experience of being a Mormon&#x2014;without polygamy, without fundamentalism&#x2014;unfolds in fascinating detail. With its revelations about a faith so often misunderstood and characterized by secrecy, <i>The Book of Mormon Girl</i> is a welcome advocate and necessary guide.</p><p><b>Joanna Brooks</b> is a national voice on Mormon life and politics, an award-winning scholar of religion and American culture, and the author or editor of five books.

With exquisite grace and eloquence, T�ib�n writes of men and women bound by convention, by unspoken emotions, by the stronghold of the past. Many are trapped in lives they would not choose again, if they ever chose at all. <br> <br> A man buries his mother and converts his grief to desire in one night. A famous singer captivates an audience, yet cannot beguile her own estranged son. And in "A Long Winter," Colm T�ib�n's finest piece of cction to date, a young man searches for his mother in the snow-covered mountains where she has sought escape from the husband who controls and confines her. <br> <br> Winner of numerous awards for his fifth novel, <i>The Master</i> -- including the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize and the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award -- T�ib�n brings to this stunning first collection an acute understanding of human frailty and longing. These are haunting, profoundly moving stories by a writer who is himself a master.</p><p>The nine stories in <i>Mothers and Sons</i> examine in depth some of the ways that the bond that is forged--or not--between mothers and their sons is altered, re-formed, or broken forever. In <i>The Master</i>, his fictionalized life of Henry James, To�b�n made the reader see and understand the writer more fully than ever before. Similarly, these new stories look at relationships between fully formed adults and, with a few deft strokes, make clear what their mutual history has brought them to. In most cases, they must deal with loss, while trying to grasp the complexities of that sometimes precarious balance between a mother and her son. <p> In the first story, "The Use of Reason," a lifelong burglar is nearly brought down by his mother, who talks too much when she drinks in her local pub. In "A Song," Noel, on the town with a group of his musician friends, ends up in the same bar as his estranged mother, who is asked to sing. She sings an Irish ballad about love and treachery and he is convinced that she is singing directly to him. In "A Priest in the Family," Molly's son Frank is accused of abuse, but no one has the courage to tell her until it is almost time for the trial. Her reaction is not entirely predictable. "Three Friends" takes place after a young man attends his mother's funeral. He joins his friends for a night of carousing and drugs ending with a late-night swim, where he is emboldened to make an overt sexual pass at one of his buddies, with interesting results. The final story, "A Long Winter," is set in Spain in a remote village. Miquel's mother drinks. Everyone knows it but Miquel. His father pours out her supply of booze and she leaves the house. So far it's a simple story. It doesn't stay that way. Each of these stories has its own gravitas, its own sadness, and that laser-beam of insight that is To�b�n's trademark. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>Colm T�ib�n is the author of nine novels, including <i>The Blackwater Lightship</i>; <i>The Master</i>, winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Prize; <i>Brooklyn</i>, winner of the Costa Book Award; <i>The Testament of Mary</i>; and <i>Nora Webster</i>, as well as two story collections, and <i>Mad, Bad, Dangerous to Know</i>, a look at three nineteenth-century Irish authors.

Generals Meade and Lee continued where they had left off, executing daring marches while boldly maneuvering the chess pieces of war in an effort to gain decisive strategic and tactical advantage. Cavalry actions crisscrossed the rolling landscape; bloody battle revealed to both sides the command deficiencies left in the wake of Gettysburg. It was the first and only time in the war Meade exercised control of the Army of the Potomac on his own terms. Jeffrey Wm Hunt brilliant dissects these and others issues in Meade and Lee at Bristoe Station: The Problems of Command and Strategy After Gettysburg, from Brandy Station to the Buckland Races, August 1 to October 31, 1863.<br><br>The carnage of Gettysburg left both armies in varying states of command chaos as the focus of the war shifted west. Lee further depleted his ranks by dispatching James Longstreet (his best corps commander) and most of his First Corps via rail to reinforce Bragg&#x2019;s Army of Tennessee. The Union defeat that followed at Chickamauga, in turn, forced Meade to follow suit with the XI and XII Corps. Despite these reductions, the aggressive Lee assumed the strategic offensive against his more careful Northern opponent, who was also busy waging a rearguard action against the politicians in Washington.<br><br>Meade and Lee at Bristoe Station is a fast-paced, dynamic account of how the Army of Northern Virginia carried the war above the Rappahannock once more in an effort to retrieve the laurels lost in Pennsylvania. When the opportunity beckoned Lee took it, knocking Meade back on his heels with a threat to his army as serious as the one Pope had endured a year earlier. As Lee quickly learned again, A. P. Hill was no Stonewall Jackson, and with Longstreet away Lee&#x2019;s cudgel was no longer as mighty as he wished. The high tide of the campaign ebbed at Bristoe Station with a signal Confederate defeat. The next move was now up to Meade.<br><br>Hunt&#x2019;s follow-up volume to his well-received Meade and Lee After Gettysburg is grounded upon official reports, regimental histories, letters, newspapers, and other archival sources. Together, they provide a day-by-day account of the fascinating high-stakes affair during this three-month period. Coupled with original maps and outstanding photographs, this new study offers a significant contribution to Civil War literature.</p><p>Jeffrey William Hunt is Director of the Texas Military Forces Museum, the official museum of the Texas National Guard in Austin, Texas and an adjunct professor of History at Austin Community College, where he has taught since 1988. He had also served for many years as the Curator of Collections and Director of the Living History Program at the Admiral Nimitz National Museum of the Pacific War in Fredericksburg, Texas.

We&#39;ve been convinced that happiness is something that only comes once we hit that goal weight, get those washboard abs, shrink ourselves down and change every part of ourselves. We believe that our bodies are the problem, but this is not true. It&#39;s how we&#39;ve been taught to see our bodies that&#39;s the problem... It&#39;s time for us all to stop believing the lies we&#39;ve been fed about what it means to be beautiful, and take our power back. Megan&#39;s body image issues began when she was five years old. She spent her childhood chasing thinness, and at fourteen found herself spiralling into anorexia. After recovery she spent years dieting, binging, losing and gaining weight. But then she found body positivity, quit dieting, and finally escaped the cult of thin. Now she&#39;s determined to let as many people as possible know the truth: that we are all good enough as we are. With her inimitable flair, whip-smart wit and kickass attitude, Megan argues for a new way of seeing ourselves, and a world where every body is celebrated. Where there is no such thing as a &#39;bikini body diet&#39; and 97% of women don&#39;t hate the way they look.

W Publishing continues its successful marketing technique of repackaging Lucado titles for various niche audiences with this smaller gift book, filled with some of the best illustrations and anecdotes from Just Like Jesus. At a time when readers seem to be gravitating toward easily digestible small hardbacks from A-list authors, Lucado's book will appeal both to longtime fans while reeling in some new and younger readers. The content is all familiar (if it ain't broke... ), but this offering is as polished as Lucado's books always are; if anything, his prose seems to shine more clearly in its concise format. Gone, though, are the original book's most whimsical chapters (such as "Finding Gold in the Garbage") and some of its intriguing and speculative tangents. However, Lucado's conversational, fireside-chat style remains a soothing balm to troubled readers who share his hope that they, too, can develop "a heart like Jesus." Biblically grounded and sprinkled with helpful anecdotes from Lucado's everyday life (much of which seems to be conducted on airplanes and in airports), this gift book offers substantive content in a Lilliputian package.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Perfect Lover (Cynster series)</h2><p><p>Never let it be said that a Cynster male can't face up to the one unassailable truth: A successful marriage gives life its fullest meaning. To all of English society, Simon Frederick Cynster has a perfect life&#x2014;one of enormous wealth and impeccable social status. His lean handsomeness turns the heads of na�ve debutantes, while his sensual allure ensures he never lacks for more sophisticated partners for a night, or more, of pleasure. Yet despite all of this, Simon knows that there is something&#x2014;or rather someone&#x2014;missing in his life.</p><p>To achieve true contentment, Simon must find a lady accomplished enough to be his wife, someone who will spend her days as a member of one of England's most influential families ... and her nights pursuing duties of a more private&#x2014;and personal&#x2014;nature.</p><p>But Simon knows what to expect if he reveals his intention to choose a bride; nothing could be more tiresome than having every blushing miss on the marriage mart thrust upon him. So he discreetly begins his search at a house party at Glossup Hall . . . and is astonished that the lady who immediately captures his interest is Portia Ashford.</p><p>Simon has never considered Portia as a potential wife. He's known the raven-haired beauty since childhood; she's willfully independent and has always claimed to be uninterested in marriage. But an unexpectedly heated kiss abruptly alters the rules of their decade-long interaction. Soon they begin to long for the moments they can spend in each other's arms.</p><p>But all is not as it seems at Glossup Hall. As Simon and Portia begin to explore the depths of their mutual passion, a shocking murder is committed ... and it appears that the next victim will be Portia herself. And even more shocking than the fact that a murderer secretly walks among them is the realization that all of Simon's considerable strength and influence may not be enough to protect Portia&#x2014;his once and always perfect lover . . .</p></p><p>Setting: England, 1835<br> Sensuality: 8<p> A wealthy and powerful rake of the English ton, Simon Cynster has known Portia Ashford, equally wealthy and well-educated, since they were children. By sheer chance, he decides it's time to find a wife at the same time that she decides she wants children and must find a husband. Knowing each other so well is both a blessing and a curse, for when it dawns on Simon that he's in love with Portia, he's well aware that she'll feel challenged by his protectiveness and wary of having her independence curtailed. For her part, Portia feels safe exploring her newly awakened sensuality with Simon, but she&#x2019;s not at all sure that he'll make a suitable husband.

Allen Weinstein (author of a highly regarded history of the Hiss-Chambers case, <i>Perjury</i>) and Alexander Vassiliev (a KGB agent turned journalist) show that among the Americans caught in the Soviet orbit were many top government officials, including a Congressman from New York and a close advisor to President Roosevelt, as well as an American ambassador's daughter. Most of these early spies were leftists driven by ideology--as opposed to money, which seems to have motivated many of the later cold war traitors, such as Aldrich Ames. (The Congressman, interestingly, is an exception--he demanded so much compensation that the Soviets gave him the code name "Crook.") The greatest windfall for the U.S.S.R. during this period was the acquisition of atomic secrets, with contributions from agents like Ted Hall, Klaus Fuchs, and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg (the authors do not believe, however, that the scientist Robert Oppenheimer was a Soviet spook). Yet there were also notable failures, many brought on by Stalin's insatiable appetite for purges; defections by Chambers and Elizabeth Bentley also dealt several mortal blows. By the end of the 1940s, the Soviet spy ring in the United States was in serious breakdown. Weinstein and Vassiliev make use of both American sources and Soviet archives to deliver what will surely be an authoritative account for many years--or at least until more top-secret archives on both sides of the Atlantic become declassified. And don't expect that to happen anytime soon. <i>--John J. Miller</i>"An important contribution to the history of the Cold War"<br> --Publishers Weekly (starred review)<p>"[Weinstein and Vassiliev] have very effectively raided the KGB archives to gather the fullest account to date of Soviet espionage in the U.S. up to the '50s ....

The pandemic ravaged families, leaving thousands of children as orphans. But in the tenement apartments of New York City&#39;s Lower East Side, one young girl is determined to keep her family safe. While her mother is sick with consumption, nine-year-old Loretta (Rettie) Stanowski does all the cleaning, washing, shopping, and cooking for her family. To earn money, she washes rags for the rag picker and cleans the halls and stairways of their apartment building. But Rettie knows the best way to get even more money is to participate in the Ragamuffin Parade that marches down Broadway Avenue on Thanksgiving morning. With the influenza outbreak, quarantines are ordered and large gatherings are banned. Will the parade be cancelled?</p><p>Trinka Hakes Noble is the award-winning author of numerous picture books, including<br>The Legend of Sea Glass and The Orange Shoes.Gr 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;Vivid artwork and a descriptive narrative re-create a vibrant 1918 New York City populated by immigrants struggling to survive an influenza pandemic at the tail end of World War I. Rettie is nine and the oldest of four siblings; she labors to keep their Lower East Side tenement home clean and earns money by washing rags while their father fights in the war and their mother is sick from consumption. Rettie eagerly anticipates the Ragamuffin Parade, in which children dress as beggars on Thanksgiving morning and parade through the streets asking, "Have ya anythin' for Thanksgiving?" Rettie knows the parade may be the only way her family has something special for Thanksgiving but worries that the growing influenza threat may cancel the event. Noble succeeds at conveying the real hardship of immigrant life during the early 20th century while Gardner's artwork breathes vibrancy into the story. His watercolor-and-pencil illustrations reinforce the tone, somber grays dominating one scene where Rettie meets her bedridden mother's eyes. The only bright spots of color are her siblings' clothes and her own patched sweater, as her mother's gleaming gold wedding ring reminds readers that Rettie's father is off fighting overseas. An author's note cites the historical information.

First published in 1890, Principles of Economics stands as Marshall&#39;s most influential work. This abridged edition offers a general introduction to the study of economics, dealing mainly with normal conditions of industry, employment, and wages. It begins by isolating the primary relations of supply, demand, and price in regard to a particular commodity. Following his study of science, history, and philosophy, Marshall argues that, while fragmentary statistical hypotheses are used as temporary aids to dynamic economic concepts, the central idea of economics must be that of a living force and movement, and its main concern must be with human beings who are impelled, for better or worse, to change and progress.</p><p><b>ALFRED MARSHALL, </b>distinguished British economist, was born in London on July 26, 1842. His interest in economics arose out of his earlier studies of philosophy and mathematics. Following his tenure as first principal of University College, Bristol (1877�1881), Marshall taught at Cambridge University from 1885 to 1908, and lived in Cambridge for the remainder of his life.<br><br> Marshall's chief work is the <i>Principles of Economics </i>(1890; eighth edition 1920). One of the founders of the so-called neo�classical school, Marshall argued that the economy would run best if left on its own, and that the normal functioning of a market econ�omy leads to full employment. Though influenced by the ideas of John Stuart Mill, Marshall substantially altered Mill's frame of ref�erence: instead of analyzing how the production of goods and the distribution of income among different social classes affected, often dramatically, economic well-being, he studied price setting in a static context, focusing on small, gradual changes and the complex interrelations by which market balance, or "equilibrium," is achieved. And while the earlier political economists Adam Smith and David Ricardo had identified labor as the force deter�mining the exchange value of goods, Marshall identified it as sat�isfaction of consumers' desires, or utility.<br><br> Marshall's orderly Victorian picture of supply, demand, and price, particularly at a time when contemporary socialists and trade unions were challenging the status quo, came under attack by later economists, including John Maynard Keynes, who demon�strated that market forces can be ineffective in promoting full employment and who advocated enlightened government inter�vention over laissez-faire policies. Nonetheless, Marshall's work continues to influence orthodox economics. Alfred Marshall died in Cambridge on July 13, 1924.<br><br> Marshall's other published works include <i>Industry and Trade </i>(1919) and <i>Money, Credit, and Commerce </i>(1923).<p>"It is impossible to understand economics in the twentieth century without knowing about Marshall's Principles. The simplicity of his presentation conceals complexities that were not apparent to later generations who picked up on the mathematics whilst ignoring many of the evolutionary ideas that fascinate modern scholars."</p> <p> Roger E. Backhouse, Professor of the History and Philosophy of Economics, University of Birmingham, UK</p> <p>"Alfred Marshall's Principles of Economics is an outstanding contribution, one of the foundations of neoclassical economics, and shaped the thought of economists from John Maynard Keynes to Milton Friedman. Every modern economist should make its acquaintaince and should look in admiration at that seminal diagram in which Marshall drew a supply curve intersecting a demand curve. Peter Groenewegen, Marshall's biographer and the greatest living Marshall scholar, has written a new introduction for this edition, drawing on a lifetime of insightful scholarship."</p> <p> Robert W.

Spearheaded by the vision of Gov. Dewitt Clinton, New York State built the waterway that opened the West to settlement and made New York City the center of finance and commerce. Opened in 1825, the canal proved so commercially viable that construction of an enlarged Erie Canal began just eleven years later. The success of the canal spawned the growth of cities, towns, businesses, and industries along its route in upstate New York. Erie Canal takes you on a ride through the heyday of the old Erie Canal. You can swim with the Volunteer Life Saving Corps as they sharpen their skills, view images of mule-drawn boats wending their way through scenic countryside, and marvel at the engineering of the bridges, aqueducts, and locks that facilitated the functioning of the canal. Erie Canal travels a step back in time and illuminates the people whose lives were shaped by the canal.</p><p>The Erie Canal Museum, founded in 1962, seeks to keep Erie Canal history and heritage alive. Martin Morganstein, development director of the museum, and Joan H. Cregg, volunteer guide and researcher at the museum, have carefully selected from the museum&#39;s extensive collection over two hundred images that depict life on the Erie Canal. These early images highlight canal cities and towns and the people that gave these places their spirit and vibrancy. They display the beauty of nineteenth-century rural New York and take your imagination on a trip through a bygone era on the Erie Canal.</p><h2>The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice (Studies in Ancient Oriental Civilization)</h2><p>To date, no comprehensive treatment of Egyptian magic has focused on the practice of the magician. Both general studies and textual publications have emphasized instead the religious elements in the contents of recited spells, while the accompanying instructions, with their vignettes and lists of materials, instruments, and ritual actions, remained uninvestigated. This study represents the first critical examination of such &#34;magical techniques,&#34; revealing their widespread appearance and pivotal significance for all Egyptian &#34;religious&#34; practices from the earliest periods through the Coptic era, influencing as well the Greco-Egyptian magical papyri. The author also discusses the &#34;pagan-Egyptian&#34; influence on Old and New Testament practices and in the lives of the Coptic Desert Fathers. The third edition is a reprinting of the second, which included minor corrections from the original edition. This volume is a significant revisionist approach to ancient Egyptian magic. As a result of a methodical analysis of both the textual and archaeological records, Ritner concludes that the boundaries between ancient Egyptian magic, religion, and medicine were not as strictly observed as modern commentators believe. Furthermore, he categorically denies the frequent attempts of moderns to define ancient Egyptian magic as a phenomenon dealing with the supernatural, practiced primarily for nefarious purposes sub rosa by strictly observed as modern commentators believe. Furthermore, he categorically denies the frequent attempts of moderns to define ancient Egyptian magic as a phenomenon dealing with the supernatural, practiced primarily for nefarious purposes sub rosa by individuals outside of the religious mainstream. Ritner&#39;s engaging prose style and felicitous exegesis of even the most arcane material make for easy reading. But more important still, the content of the work ensures that it will become a vital reference tool for all engaged in any aspect of ancient Egyptian religion. [From a review by R. S.

The end is near. But others&#x2014;many others&#x2014;meet death without any warning at all, in an unforeseen moment that wrenches consciousness in two, separating the living from the dead.<br> That&#x2019;s how it would come on this particular evening for twenty-two individuals.<br> A darkened sky released sheets of overzealous, unwelcome flakes into the air. The wind caught them up and blew them sideways. The same wind tore strands of hair from the woman&#x2019;s ponytail and whipped them about like flickering candle flames. She clutched a box tightly to her chest, the contents rattling, as she hurried up the cement&nbsp;&nbsp; steps.<br> With her chin burrowed deep into her scarf and eyes lowered, the woman didn&#x2019;t see the man as she reached the platform. She didn&#x2019;t see him stare at the train. She didn&#x2019;t see him as he exhaled a cloudy breath. And she didn&#x2019;t see him when he spun around.<br> The two collided, as lives sometimes do.<br> The woman tottered and fell, the box upending. She landed hard on the snow-covered cement, auburn hair spilling about her face.<br> The man moved to her, pulled her up. &#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d; &#x201c;I-I think so.&#x201d;<br> He scrambled to collect the scattered contents&#x2014;a handful of business cards, a spiral-bound notebook, a balled-up T-shirt, an opened bag of Tootsie Pops, and a picture frame.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he said.<br> &#x201c;No, it was my fault. I wasn&#x2019;t looking. I didn&#x2019;t want to . . .&#x201d; Her words swirled off into the wind. She tucked her hair behind her ear, her attention moving to the broken picture frame he held in his hand.<br> He shook pieces of glass into the snow, then returned the framed photo to the box and handed it over. &#x201c;Are you sure you&#x2019;re all right?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; And yet she was unable to hide the wince that came with her words.<br> The railcar waited behind him, its doors open.<br> She hugged the box to her chest and stepped forward, before they closed. Before she had to wait for the next train to come along.<br> Dry air washed over her face and neck. The doors slid shut. The rail- car released its brakes. A voice distorted with static sounded over the inter- com as the train lurched forward. She steadied herself against a nearby pole and stared out the window. The man stood beneath the awning, watching the train slide past as snow and wind swirled in a frantic dance across the sky.<br> Circles of pain radiated from her backside. She brushed a patch of white clinging to her coat and glanced down the railcar. Her attention caught on a lady with hair like her own, sitting close by, clutching an expensive-looking handbag while she dabbed her cheeks with a crumpled pink tissue.<br> As if sensing the attention, the lady&#x2019;s watery eyes rose up to meet the woman&#x2019;s.<br> Flushing, she turned away. The car wasn&#x2019;t too full, so she slid onto an empty seat a couple rows ahead, setting the box beside her.<br> Cold stuck to her skin. Her teeth chattered. She yearned for a hot cup of tea. A long soak in a warm bath. Something that might chase away the coldness that had seeped inside her bones long before she stepped outside.<br> She removed the five-by-seven picture frame from the box and flicked a sliver of glass from the photograph when someone tapped her shoulder.<br> It was a man.<br> He sat behind her wearing a green-mesh John Deere hat with a straight bill, like he&#x2019;d never bothered to break it in. His back was hunched with age. &#x201c;Crazy weather this evening.&#x201d;<br> She nodded.<br> &#x201c;Last time we got this much snow this late in the year, I had more hair up here.&#x201d; He took off his cap and with a chuckle, rubbed the top of his shiny brown head. &#x201c;They say when all&#x2019;s said and done, we could get up to a foot.&#x201d;<br> The woman&#x2019;s lips pinched in the corners&#x2014;a polite but discouraging smile.<br> Maybe if she had known that this would be the old man&#x2019;s last conversation, she would have done a better job. Maybe if she had known, she would have been more attentive. At the very least, she could have shown a glimmer of kindness.<br> But she didn&#x2019;t know. None of them did.<br> Not the girl with the pixie haircut and the pair of tattooed butterflies rising on the nape of her neck. Not the Latino boy slumped down in his seat, earbuds jammed inside his ears. Not the harassed-looking mother trying to corral a wild young child. Not the businessman tapping the keys on his opened laptop. Not the crying wisp of a lady with the crumpled pink tissue. Not the old man who smelled of analgesic cream and bacon and prattled on about snowstorms in March.<br> Not the woman with the box, whose phone began buzzing. She gave the gentleman an apologetic look and pulled the phone out of her pocket. A text message lit the screen:<br> R u alive?<br> A short huff.<br> She slipped off her mother&#x2019;s ring and stared at the familiar design. If she hadn&#x2019;t done that&#x2014;if she would have just given it a twist instead of re- moving it altogether&#x2014;maybe some things would have turned out differently. But she did take it off. She turned it over in her hand, clasped it inside her palm. And then she tapped out a text with trembling thumbs. It was a message that would never be sent. One that would be lost with all the other things that were lost on that day. Halfway through her typed reply, a second ticked from one to zero.<br> Fate detonated.<br> An explosion of heat blasted through the air. <br> Windows shattered.<br> Metal twisted.<br> Stars burst like kaleidoscopes behind the woman&#x2019;s eyes, and life as she knew it disappeared completely.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>O N E</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Sirens wailed.<br> A woman screamed.<br> Impossible heat reached out heavy fingers and dug into her flesh, pulling her into darkness. Charred gloves circled her wrists and dragged her from the wreckage as flames swallowed the world.<br> Autumn Manning jolted awake.<br> Sweat dripped down her back as she shoved away the sounds, kicking them off like an unwanted blanket. She pushed at the sheets covering her legs and tore at her face, clawing at tubes that were no longer there. Tubes that had been removed months and months ago.<br> Panic swelled.<br> It scratched up her chest, heaving her upright in bed.<br> It was just a nightmare. Fiery wreckage didn&#x2019;t engulf her. There was no hospital or beeping monitors. She was in her apartment bedroom, where all was quiet and still and safe.<br> The clock on her nightstand read 3:36 a.m.&#x2014;an hour most people didn&#x2019;t care to know. But 3:00 a.m. and Autumn had become well acquainted. At 3:00, sleep turned into a will-o&#x2019;-the-wisp&#x2014;teasing her as it danced forever out of reach.<br> It was better not to chase it at all.<br> She swung her legs around and shoved her feet into a pair of slippers, slid her arms into the robe hanging on one of her bedposts and shuffled past the closet that made her family worry.<br> Ten minutes later, Autumn was curled up in an armchair with a hot cup of tea, flipping through options on Netflix, trying to ignore the ghosts that called to her from down the hall. She had promised her sister that she would stop, that she would find a way to let all of this go.<br> But the dead were loudest at night.<br> Ribbons of steam curled up toward her chin. Autumn selected an episode of Gilmore Girls and turned her attention to the jigsaw puzzle scattered across the coffee table. The more things she could distract herself with, the better.<br> Television, tea, puzzle.<br> This one was called &#x201c;Forest Gnome&#x201d; and was extra difficult, given that most of the pieces were the same shade of barky brown. Mindlessly, she picked at a cuticle as she searched for a piece of the gnome&#x2019;s hat.<br> Pick, pick, pick until her skin stung.<br> She stuck her thumb in her mouth and sucked, then pulled it free and watched as red beaded up into a droplet of blood. If she didn&#x2019;t cover it, she would continue picking&#x2014;an unflattering habit she developed as a girl.<br> &#x201c;Stop picking, my love,&#x201d; her mother would say, peeking at her in the rearview mirror of their Buick LeSabre. &#x201c;Your nails look dreadful.&#x201d;<br> Autumn headed to the bathroom, where she wrapped her thumb in a lime-green Band-Aid and stared at her reflection in the mirror. A straight scar slashed across her temple. A feathery one peppered her right jawline like white stubble&#x2014;so vague now a person had to squint to see it. There was another on her shoulder where she&#x2019;d had surgery&#x2014;this scar more serious looking than the others. But that was it. The only outward sign that she&#x2019;d survived anything at all.<br> Three faint scars, where skin had been savagely torn but stretched and bound together again.<br> Gilmore Girls banter filtered down the hallway.<br> Autumn knew she should return to her chair and her tea and work on the puzzle while Taylor Doose tried bringing the citizens of Stars Hollow to order. When the episode ended, she could clean out her refrigerator&#x2014; scrub it with baking soda and vinegar until she found a way to remove the mysterious sour smell that came and went in whiffs without any rhyme or reason. When that was through, she could lace up her shoes and go on an early-morning run.<br> But temptation was hard to resist at three in the morning.<br> She was impossibly drawn to the things she promised to throw away.<br> &nbsp;With resignation, she grabbed a pair of scissors, the copy of the Tribune featuring the articles she read before bed, and the binder from the top shelf of the hall closet. She pressed her back against the wall and slid to the floor, where she cut out the newest headline.<br> <b>Tragedy on the Tracks: One Year Later</b><br> The alliteration grated. It had always grated, causing a grimace when- ever she saw or read it.<br> The commission board in charge of erecting a memorial had worked with a local artist to design a fountain. They&#x2019;d settled on a large steel phoenix, taking flight from the water. A symbol of hope. Beauty from ashes. A symbol Autumn had yet to see unfold in real life. Even the beauty of justice eluded her.<br> The bomber, Benjamin Havel, was still on the loose.<br> The ground surrounding the fountain was embedded with twenty- two red bricks, each one inscribed with a name. Nearby a plaque explained all that it represented. It was a plaque that would remain largely unread, and eventually, the fountain would be nothing more than a wet trash can for unwanted pennies and stale gum.<br> Autumn sighed.<br> Was Chad right? Had she turned cynical?<br> She finished cutting out the article, trying not to think about the voice mail from the chairman of the board, inviting her to cut the ribbon at the opening ceremony. Or her sister Claire&#x2019;s disbelief when Autumn told her she wouldn&#x2019;t be going.<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re really not going?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d asked.<br> &#x201c;Trust me,&#x201d; Autumn had said. &#x201c;Those families don&#x2019;t want me there.&#x201d; Why would they? To them, she was salt in a wound. A bitter re- minder. A cruel question mark. Why did that woman survive when my husband (wife, dad, mom, son, daughter, friend) didn&#x2019;t? What&#x2019;s so special<br> about her?<br> Autumn didn&#x2019;t want to see the questions that haunted her reflected in wet eyes. And she refused to be a mascot. If she went, she would be a dis- traction. A spectacle. The focal point. The memorial wasn&#x2019;t about her. It was about them&#x2014;the ones who hadn&#x2019;t survived.<br> She didn&#x2019;t need to cut a ribbon to pay her respects. She did that every day.<br> Every night.<br> While the city slept, she paid them over and over again.<br> Her attention wandered to the binder in her lap. She paged past the stack of obituaries&#x2014;all of which had been written and published while she was still unconscious. By the time she opened her eyes, the dead were al- ready buried. Autumn had to Google their names to read their stories, and gather old newspapers from libraries for physical, tangible records. To her family&#x2019;s dismay, she turned into a morbid kid collecting a set of tragic baseball cards, determined to gather her favorite players. Only instead of a bonus stick of bubblegum with each find, she got a knife to the gut.<br> She turned past each one of them until she reached the letters&#x2014;all from one address. They began arriving a few days after she woke up and the media descended.<br> At first, the letters just confused her.<br> Eventually it became clear. Autumn understood what it was like when your mind fixated on something. When it gnawed and gnawed like a dog with a bone. That must be it. For reasons she thought she understood, she had become that bone.<br> She got up from her spot in the hallway. She didn&#x2019;t think as she powered up her Mac, and she didn&#x2019;t think as she logged onto a fake Facebook account, and she didn&#x2019;t think as she typed names and hashtags into the search bar. Always the same ones. It had become a tick. A compulsion. Like picking at her cuticles. She had to do it, even though it never made her feel any better. Not when her searches produced something new and not when she discovered accounts had finally been deleted. No matter what Autumn found, all of it ended the same way&#x2014;her, sitting there, nursing the wounds all the picking left behind, not a Band-Aid in sight.<br> Three hundred and sixty-five days.<br> One whole year since the people inside the binder had ceased living. Twelve months with the same question as her constant, vigilant companion. The same question her two-year old niece had begun asking repeatedly a couple of weeks ago.<br> Why? Why? Why?<br> With a deep breath, Autumn picked up a nearby pencil and snagged a piece of paper and tried&#x2014;for the hundredth time&#x2014;to write a letter back.</p><h2>Christology: A Global Introduction</h2><p>In this revised introduction, an internationally respected scholar explores biblical, historical, and contemporary developments in Christology.

Men, could <strong><em>just one hormone</em></strong> keep you healthy, strong, virile, and fully productive until you die? The answer is "yes," and that hormone is <em>testosterone</em>--more than merely an antidote to ED.</p><p>There is much more to testosterone replacement that you may think. The <em>nature</em> and <em>delivery system</em> for receiving testosterone can make all the difference between accelerating the diseases of aging-- and preventing them. Bioidentical testosterone pellet therapy is the only method of testosterone replacement that reverses ED and also prevents the diseases of aging: </p> <ul> <li>Diabetes</li> <li>Cancer</li> <li>Heart disease</li> <li>Obesity</li> <li>High cholesterol</li> <li>Parkinson's disease</li> <li>Alzheimer's disease</li> <li>Osteoperosis</li> <li>Frailty</li> <li>Autoimmune diseases</li> </ul> <p><strong>You don't have to succumb to these diseases or live the miserable life of an aging, impotent, frail old man</strong>! Testosterone pellets can change this, and that's what this book is about.</p> <p><em>Dr. Maupin's approach to testosterone replacement "offers science-based medicine and is psychologically sound ... This is pioneering work and mainstream medicine will be following her lead. </em></p> <p><em>Michael E. Mahon, PsyD</em></p></p><p>Dr. Kathy Maupin has practiced obstetrics and gynecology for more than thirty years, and for more than sixteen years, she has specialized in hormone replacement for men and women using testosterone pellets. She received bioidentical hormone pellet replacement therapy herself after a hysterectomy at age forty-seven, as a last-ditch attempt to save her health, her career, her family life, and her happiness. Dr. Maupin credits the treatment with saving her life. She now helps both men and women worldwide discover the importance and life-changing benefits of testosterone replacement. In 2003, she founded BioBalance Health(R), a medical practice dedicated to helping women and men treat the symptoms of aging with bioidentical testosterone pellets, preventive medical treatment, dietary supplements, and exercise. Dr. Maupin not only has a lifetime of experience in treating men and women medically. She also developed and successfully promoted legislation in the state of Missouri that benefits patients as well as doctors. She wrote the Missouri healthcare initiative, that became the first state to adopt this law in 2001, that required insurance companies to pay for breast reconstruction after mastectomy. In 2015, she and co-author Brett Newcomb published their first book, The Secret Female Hormone: How Testosterone Can Save Your Life, published in six countries.<br><br>Brett Newcomb has thirty-five years of experience in private practice as a family therapist. He has worked with Dr. Maupin for years to help her patients deal with the psychological and marital ramifications of hormone imbalance and the necessary adjustments that follow successful treatment. Brett was also Teacher of the Year at Lafayette High School in Saint Louis, Missouri, and rose from adjunct professor of counseling to be worldwide director of the counseling program at Webster University in Saint Louis, Missouri. He has consulted with schools around the country and has been a workshop pre- senter for major international corporations.<p>Praise for <em>Got Testosterone?</em></p><p>"In my practice, we check the testosterone levels of all men over the age of thirty-five who feel depressed. We do this before we discuss antidepression medications or engage in a course of talk therapy. Checking their testosterone is the starting point.</p><p>The power of Dr. Maupin and Mr. Newcomb's approach is that it offers science-based medicine and is psychologically sound, all in one package. It's often difficult to find the former in the average low-T clinic; it's unheard of to find the latter. This is pioneering work, and mainstream medicine will be following their lead."</p><p>-- Michael E. Mahon, PsyD Saint Louis, Missouri</p><p>"As both trailblazers and advocates for women's health, Dr. Kathy Maupin and Brett Newcomb let the secret out when they revealed the absolute importance testosterone plays in promoting the health and well-being of women in their first book, The Secret Female Hormone. Applying the training and education received at Dr. Maupin's clinic in St. Louis using the pellet method for bioidentical hormone replacement, the female patients seen in our clinic experience a higher quality of life, better health, and a restored personal sense of well-being. As a result, many of them ask, "What can I do to get my husband to come see you?" The answer is now quite simple: Have him read this book and let's see what happens! I am grateful for this important resource that emphasizes the crucial role testosterone plays in men's health."</p><p>-- Jason M. Kolodjski, DC, MSN, APRN, FNP-C Clinic Director, Natural Health Center Houston, Texas</p><p>"This book gave me the information I needed to get my head out the sand and get some extensive lab work done. I found out that I had a serious testosterone deficiency that was causing me a lot of issues. Dr. Maupin had talked to me about my joint pain and inflammation for several years before I tried the T pellets. The pellets turned my body clock back twenty years, and now I have a new energy level, I sleep great, I have no more joint pain or inflammation, and my wife is very happy."</p><p>-- Brian Dunlop, JD Saint Louis, Missouri</p></p><h2>In the Path of Destruction: Eyewitness Chronicles of Mount St. Helens</h2><p>"The air had no oxygen, like being trapped underwater...I was being cremated, the pain unbearable."--Jim Scymanky <p> "I was on my knees, my back to the hot wind.

"Rocks zinged through the woods, bouncing off trees, then the tops of trees snapped off...Suddenly I could see nothing...it got hot right away, then scorching hot and impossible to breathe...I was being cremated, the pain unbearable." <p> Mike Hubbard was further away--sixteen miles northwest, near Green River. "I was on my knees, my back to the hot wind. It blew me along, lifting my rear so I was up on my hands...It was hot but I didn't feel burned--until I felt my ears curl." </p><p> Steve Malone, at the University of Washington Seismology Laboratory, was inconsolable. "We'd failed. For two months we'd counted and located thousands of earthquakes, looked for changes to anticipate an eruption. Then it just happened. It killed many people...We could hardly work." </p><p> *** </p><p> Author Richard Waitt was part of a U.S. Geological Survey team conducting volcano research in the Cascades, and was one of the first to arrive following the mountain's early rumblings. His journey collecting eyewitness accounts began with a conversation in a bar the third week after Mount St. Helens erupted. The couple he met barely outraced a searing ash cloud, and Waitt realized their experiences could inform geologic studies. He eventually completed hundreds of interviews--sometimes two and three decades later--often making multiple visits. </p><p> A meticulous scientist with intimate knowledge of Mount St. Helens, Waitt also tapped legal depositions, personal diaries, geologists' field notes, and more to present a detailed and accurate chronicle of events. "In the Path of Destruction" depicts the eruption through unforgettable, riveting narratives--the heart of a masterful chronology that also delivers engrossing science, history, and journalism.</p></p><h2>A Humument: A Treated Victorian Novel</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;A &#x2018;treated Victorian novel&#x2019;&#x2015;treated with humor and poetry, and a feeling for the &#x2018;ghosts of other possible stories&#x2019; lurking in the original text.

There. I know him. He has been a young punk in Ukraine, the idol of the Soviet underground; a bum, then a multimillionaire's butler in Manhattan; a fashionable writer in Paris; a lost soldier in the Balkans; and now, in the fantastic shambles of postcommunism, the elderly but charismatic leader of a party of young desperadoes. He sees himself as a hero; you might call him a scumbag: I suspend my judgment on the matter. It's a dangerous life, an ambiguous life: a real adventure novel. It is also, I believe, a life that says something. Not just about him, Limonov, not just about Russia, but about all our history since the end of the Second World War."</p><p>So Eduard Limonov isn't fictional-but he might as well be. This pseudobiography isn't a novel, but it reads like one: from Limonov's grim childhood to his desperate, comical, ultimately successful attempts to gain the respect of Russia's literary intellectual elite; to his immigration to New York, then to Paris; to his return to the motherland. <i>Limonov</i> could be read as a charming picaresque. But it could also be read as a troubling counternarrative of the second half of the twentieth century, one that reveals a violence, an anarchy, a brutality, that the stories we tell ourselves about progress tend to conceal.</p></p><p><p><b>Emmanuel Carr�re</b>, born in Paris in 1957, is a writer, scriptwriter, and film producer.

This new name pays tribute to Felix Dzerzhinsky, one of the earliest Bolsheviks and founder of the secret police agency that has throughout its history been known as the Cheka, GPU, NKVD, KGB, and is today called the FSB. In this book we will meet it in the form of the last three of these menacing acronyms, but Russians, in addition to the designations of each era, call it, even more ominously, <i>organy</i>: the organs. The war is raging; heavy industry has been dismantled and relocated to the hinterland, out of the theater of operations. In this way, a weapons factory in Dzerzhinsk ends up employing the city&#x2019;s entire population, as well as NKVD troops to watch over them. It&#x2019;s a time of heroism and brutality: a worker who arrives five minutes late is court-martialed, and it&#x2019;s the Chekists, as the secret police are called, who arrest, sentence, and execute him, if need be, with a bullet to the back of the head. One night, as some Messerschmitts on a reconnaissance flight from the Lower Volga drop some bombs on the city, a soldier standing guard over the factory uses his flashlight to light the way for a young worker, who left her post late and is hurrying to a shelter. She stumbles and catches hold of his arm. He notices a tattoo on her wrist. In the darkness lit up by the glow of fires their faces come closer. Their lips touch.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>The soldier, Venyamin Savenko, is twenty-three and comes from a family of Ukrainian peasants. A skilled electrician, he was recruited by the NKVD, which plucks the best workers from every industry. So, rather than being sent to the front like most of the youths his age, he was assigned to guard a weapons factory in the countryside. He&#x2019;s far from home, which is more the rule than the exception in the Soviet Union: what with deportations, exiles, mass population transfers, people continually being shuffled around, the chances of living and dying where you were born are as good as nil.</p> <p>Raya Zybin, for her part, comes from Gorky, formerly Nizhny Novgorod, where her father directed a restaurant. In the Soviet Union you don&#x2019;t own or manage a restaurant, you direct one. It&#x2019;s not something you can start up or buy into, but a post to which you&#x2019;re assigned, and not a bad one at that. Unfortunately Raya&#x2019;s father was dismissed for embezzlement and sent to a disciplinary battalion in the battle for Leningrad, where he died not long ago. It&#x2019;s a stain on the family, and in these days, in this country, a stain on the family can ruin your life. For us it&#x2019;s one of the most basic tenets of justice that children don&#x2019;t pay for the crimes of their fathers, but in the Soviet Union it&#x2019;s not even a formal principle, something you can appeal to in theory. The children of Trotskyists, or of kulaks, as wealthy farmers are called, or of those privileged under the old regime, are doomed to live as outcasts, barred from becoming Young Pioneers, attending university, and joining the Red Army or the Party; they have one chance to escape this fate, and that&#x2019;s by renouncing their parents and being as enthusiastic about the Party as possible. And since being enthusiastic means denouncing those around you, the organs have no better helpers than those with tarnished biographies&#x2014;as is brought home by so many terrible stories in Orlando Figes&#x2019;s outstanding book <i>The Whisperers</i>, on private life under Stalin. In the case of Raya&#x2019;s father it may be that his death on the battlefield helped things somewhat; the fact is that like the Savenkos, the Zybins made it through the Great Terror of the thirties without mishap. No doubt they were simply too insignificant. This luck doesn&#x2019;t stop young Raya from being ashamed of her dishonest father, just as she&#x2019;s ashamed of the tattoo she got while she was at technical school. Later, she&#x2019;ll try to get rid of it by spraying hydrochloric acid on her wrist, because she hates not being able to wear short-sleeved dresses and, as the wife of an officer, she hates looking like a bit of a slut.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Raya&#x2019;s pregnancy coincides almost to the day with the siege of Stalingrad. Conceived in May 1942, a terrible month, the time of the most bitter defeats, Eduard is born on February 2, 1943, twenty days before the German Sixth Army capitulates and the tables turn. Repeatedly he will be told that he is a child of victory, and that he would have been born into a world of slaves if the men and women of Russia hadn&#x2019;t sacrificed their lives to prevent the city that bore Stalin&#x2019;s name from falling to the enemy. Later bad things will be said about Stalin; he&#x2019;ll be called a tyrant and his reign of terror will be denounced. But for the people of Eduard&#x2019;s generation he will remain the supreme leader of the people of the Union at the most tragic moment in their history; the man who defeated the Nazis and proved himself capable of a sacrifice worthy of the ancient Romans: the Germans had captured his son, Lieutenant Yakov Dzhugashvili, while the Russians had captured Field Marshal Paulus, one of the top military leaders of the Reich, at Stalingrad. When the German High Command proposed an exchange, Stalin responded with disdain that he didn&#x2019;t exchange field marshals for simple lieutenants. Yakov committed suicide by throwing himself on the electrified barbed wire fence of his prison camp.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Two anecdotes stand out from Eduard&#x2019;s earliest childhood. The first one, his father&#x2019;s favorite, is touching: the baby, for lack of a crib, lies in a shell crate, sucking on a herring&#x2019;s tail in place of a pacifier, smiling as if he were in seventh heaven. &#x201c;<i>Molodets</i>!&#x201d; Venyamin cries: &#x201c;Good boy! This little guy will be comfortable wherever he goes!&#x201d;</p> <p>The second anecdote, less charming, is told by Raya. She&#x2019;s downtown, carrying her baby on her back, when the Luftwaffe launches an air raid. She takes refuge in a cellar with a dozen city dwellers, some of them terrified, others apathetic. The ground and walls shake; everyone listens to gauge how far away the bombs are falling and what buildings they&#x2019;re bringing down. Little Eduard starts to cry, attracting the attention, then the rage of one guy who hisses that Fritz has ultramodern techniques for pinpointing live targets, that they home in on the faintest sounds and that the baby&#x2019;s crying will get them all killed. He does such a good job of rousing the others against Raya that they throw her out, forcing her to seek another shelter under the falling bombs. Livid with anger, she tells herself and her baby that everything people say about helping one another, about solidarity and fraternity, is just a joke. &#x201c;The truth, and never forget this, Edichka, is that men are cowards and bastards, and they&#x2019;ll kill you if you&#x2019;re not ready to strike first.&#x201d;</p> <p>2</p> <p>IN THE PERIOD following the war, cities aren&#x2019;t called cities but &#x201c;population concentrations,&#x201d; and the young Savenko family, moving from place to place as the postings come, lives in barracks and army camps in various population concentrations on the Volga before settling in February 1947 in Kharkov, now Kharkiv, in Ukraine. Kharkov, a large industrial center and rail hub, was the scene of bitter fighting between the Germans and Russians, who took and lost and retook it, each occupying the city in turn, massacring the inhabitants in the process and leaving, by the end of the war, nothing more than a field of ruins. The concrete constructivist building on Red Army Street that lodges the NKVD officers and their families&#x2014;called &#x201c;persons in charge&#x201d;&#x2014;overlooks what was once the imposing main station and is now a chaos of stones, bricks, and metal surrounded by fences that you&#x2019;re not allowed to climb over because apart from the bodies of German soldiers, there are mines and grenades strewn amid the rubble. One little boy had his hand blown off. Despite this example, the band of rascals Eduard joins likes nothing more than raiding these ruins, hunting for cartridges whose powder they empty onto the tramway tracks, causing crackling and fireworks, once even provoking a derailment that becomes legendary. In the evening, the biggest boys tell terrifying stories: of dead Fritzes who haunt the ruins on the lookout for unsuspecting stragglers; of stew pots in the cafeteria with children&#x2019;s fingers at the bottom; of cannibals and trading in human flesh. Everyone is hungry in these days, there&#x2019;s nothing to eat but bread, potatoes, and above all kasha, the buckwheat porridge that&#x2019;s part of every meal served up by poor Russians and which features occasionally in the homes of fairly well-off Parisians like me, who pride ourselves on how well we make it. Sausage is a rare luxury; Eduard is so wild about it he dreams of becoming a butcher when he grows up. No dogs, no cats, no pets: they&#x2019;d get eaten. Rats, on the other hand, abound. Twenty million Russians died in the war, but another twenty million brave the postwar period without a roof over their heads. Most children no longer have fathers; most of the men still alive are invalids. On every street corner you see people missing an arm, a leg, two legs. Everywhere you see gangs of children left to fend for themselves, children whose parents died in the war or are imprisoned as public enemies, hungry children, child thieves and child murderers, children returned to the state of nature who move about in dangerous hordes and for whom the age of criminal responsibility, that is, of the death penalty, has been lowered to twelve.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>The little boy admires his father. On Saturday evenings he likes to watch him grease his service weapon, he likes to see him put on his uniform, and nothing makes him happier than being allowed to polish his father&#x2019;s boots. He plunges one arm inside, right up to the shoulder, and spreads the polish with his other hand with care, using special brushes and cloths for each step of the operation, part of a whole kit that takes up half of Venyamin&#x2019;s suitcase when he leaves on assignment and that his son looks after, packing and unpacking it, anxious for the glorious day when he&#x2019;ll have one too. In his eyes, the only men worthy of the name are soldiers, and the only children to hang around with are the children of soldiers. He doesn&#x2019;t know any others: the families of the officers and junior officers living in the NKVD building on Red Army Street keep to themselves and have little respect for the civvies, a sniveling and undisciplined lot who are liable to stop without warning in the middle of the sidewalk, obliging the soldier to readjust his path in order to keep to the steady, energetic, regulation four-mile-an-hour pace at which Eduard will walk until the end of his days.</p> <p>To get them to go to sleep at night, the children on Red Army Street are told stories of the conflict that the Russians don&#x2019;t call the Second World War as we do but the Great Patriotic War, and their dreams are filled with caving trenches, dead horses, and brothers in arms whose heads are ripped off by an exploding shell. Eduard is thrilled by these stories. Still, he notices his father seems a bit embarrassed when his mother tells them. They&#x2019;re never about him or his adventures, but only about Eduard&#x2019;s uncle, Raya&#x2019;s brother, and the little boy doesn&#x2019;t dare ask, &#x201c;But what about you, Dad, did you go to war too? Did you fight?&#x201d;</p> <p>No, he didn&#x2019;t fight. Most of the men his age have looked death in the eye. War, his son will write later, bit them between its teeth like a suspect coin and they know, for not having bent, that they are the real thing. Not his father. He didn&#x2019;t look death in the eye. He served out the war far from the front, and his wife rarely misses a chance to remind him of it.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>She&#x2019;s hard, proud of her standing as the wife of an officer, an enemy to all tenderness. She always sides against her son and with his adversaries. If he&#x2019;s been beaten up she doesn&#x2019;t console him but lauds the aggressor: that&#x2019;ll make Eduard a man, not a sissy. One of his first memories is suffering from a serious ear infection when he was five. Pus dripped from his ear; he was deaf for several weeks. The way to the clinic where his mother took him crossed the railway tracks. He saw, rather than heard, the train as it approached&#x2014;the smoke, the speed, the shape of the black metal monster&#x2014;and he was suddenly seized by the irrational fear that she wanted to hurl him under its wheels. He started to scream: &#x201c;Mommy! Mommy! Don&#x2019;t throw me under the train! Please! Don&#x2019;t throw me under the train!&#x201d; In his account he insists on the importance of the word <i>please</i>, as if this politeness alone had dissuaded his mother from her dire project.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>When I got to know him in Paris thirty years later, Eduard liked to say his father was a Chekist, because he knew that would cast a pall over the room. Once, after he&#x2019;d gotten his kicks with this announcement, he poked fun at us: &#x201c;Stop imagining such terrible things, my dad was basically a gendarme, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;</p> <p>Really, that&#x2019;s all?</p> <p>During the civil war, just after the Revolution, Trotsky, serving as commander of the Red Army, had been obliged to press members of the imperial armed forces into service. These were professional soldiers and weapons specialists, but &#x201c;bourgeois specialists,&#x201d; and as such relatively untrustworthy. He created a corps of political commissars to control them, countersign their orders, and shoot them if they showed signs of resisting. That&#x2019;s how the principle of the &#x201c;double administration&#x201d; was born, based on the idea that to accomplish a task you need at least two men: one to do it and one to make sure he does it in conformity with Marxism-Leninism. This principle spread from the army to society at large, and in the process, it became clear that a third person was then needed to supervise the second, a fourth to supervise the third, and so on.</p> <p>Venyamin Savenko is a modest cog in this paranoid system. His work is to supervise, control, and report. That does not necessarily imply&#x2014;on this point Eduard is right&#x2014;terrible acts of repression. Let&#x2019;s not forget, as a simple NKVD orderly he spent the war planted in front of a factory. Promoted during peacetime to the modest rank of junior lieutenant, he works as a <i>nacht-kluba</i>, which you could translate as &#x201c;nightclub manager,&#x201d; but which here means organizing leisure and cultural activities for the soldiers&#x2014;dance parties on Red Army Day, for example. The job suits him well: he plays the guitar, likes to sing, and in his own way has a taste for the good things in life. He even puts clear polish on his nails: quite the dandy, this Junior Lieutenant Savenko, who, his son says in retrospect, could have led a far more interesting life if he&#x2019;d had the courage to get out from under his wife&#x2019;s thumb.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>The life of nightclubbing NKVD-style in which Venyamin to a certain extent blossoms doesn&#x2019;t last, however, because the job is swiped by one Captain Levitin, who becomes without knowing it the sworn enemy of the Savenkos and a key figure in Eduard&#x2019;s private mythology: the schemer who&#x2019;s not as good as you but is more successful, whose insolence and devilish luck not only humiliate you in front of the bosses but, even worse, in front of your family, so that the little boy, who all the while loyally parrots his parents&#x2019; disdain for Levitin, can&#x2019;t stop thinking in secret&#x2014;although he hates himself for it&#x2014;that his father is kind of pathetic and that Levitin&#x2019;s son is, actually, pretty lucky.

The work is significant not only for its illuminating assessment of Kant&#x2019;s thought but also for its elaboration of themes first broached in Being and Time, especially the problem of how Heidegger proposed to enact his destruction of the metaphysical tradition and the role that his reading of Kant would play therein.</p></p><p><p>Richard Taft is former Research Fellow at Trinity College, Hartford, and former Fulbright Fellow at the Hegel Archive of the Ruhr University in Germany.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Navajo Rugs: The Essential Guide</h2><p>An introduction to collecting and caring for Navajo rugs and woven art</p><p></p><h2>The Book of Taltos (Jhereg)</h2><p>Steven Brust&#x2019;s first three novels featuring assassin Vlad Taltos and his jhereg companion were collected in one volume as <b>The Book of Jhereg.

Without paper, modern hygienic practice would be unimaginable; as currency, people will do almost anything to possess it; and, as a tool of expression, it is inextricable from human culture.

What inspired you to write <i>On Paper</i>?</strong></p> <p>A. After writing eight books about every conceivable aspect of books and book culture, it seemed logical that I turn to the stuff of transmission itself, and for more than five hundred years in the West &#x2013; and much longer than that in Asia and the Middle East &#x2013; the medium of choice has been paper. The actual idea to write a book about paper, though, was suggested to me in 2002 by MacArthur Fellow Timothy Barrett, during a speaking visit I made to the Iowa Center for the Book at the University of Iowa. I spent several days there with Tim &#x2013; a world-renowned authority in the field of hand papermaking &#x2013; and he regaled me with stories about its history that I found irresistible. The best part about it, from my standpoint, was that no book quite like the decidedly eclectic one I ultimately envisioned had ever been done before. This is not a formal chronology by any means, but a cultural history that takes in the full sweep of this remarkably versatile material, and discusses the impact it has had on the shaping of history.</p> <p><strong>Q. Can anyone date the first appearance of an actual book?</strong></p> <p>A. By &#x201c;actual book,&#x201d; I assume you mean a &#x201c;book on paper,&#x201d; in which case the earliest known printed book to have an actual date on it is the <i>The Diamond Sutra</i>, from 868 A.D., printed on paper from carved wooden blocks, and produced more than five hundred years before Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable metal type in Europe. It was found in a cave in the Gobi Desert early in the twentieth century by the explorer Sir Aurel Stein, and is now in the British Library. But books have taken many shapes and forms over the centuries, the earliest ones written on clay tablets in Mesopotamia dating to about 3000 B.C. Others have been written on cured animal skins known as parchment and vellum, on laminated strips of a marsh reed known as papyrus, others have been incised on bamboo, silk, metal sheets, pottery, stone &#x2013; whatever material was available at the time. But once introduced as a viable medium &#x2013; and once the rudiments for making it from the pulverized fibers of a vegetative source were understood &#x2013; paper transformed everything. It was cheap to make, it was light, pliable, resilient, portable, foldable &#x2013; truly a miracle invention with a multitude of applications.</p> <p><strong>Q. This is a big question, I know, but what do you think have been paper&#x2019;s greatest contributions to history?</strong></p> <p>A. I think the fact that paper has been the medium upon which so much of our history, our literature, and our cultural heritage have been recorded for close to a thousand years, and the medium upon which each generation over that span has been able to communicate with those that follow, has to come first. Of the eighteen chapters in my book, the one I chose to be the title chapter is devoted to this concept. Another deals with the role paper has played as a tool of the creative process, with generous attention given to the notebooks of Leonard da Vinci, Beethoven, and Thomas Edison. But paper has done so many other remarkable things, it is almost impossible to single out one function as being stronger than all the others. Architecture as we know it today, for instance, or engineering in which plans must be drawn precisely to scale, the making of photographic images, the emergence in Ottoman times of the modern bureaucracy, are unthinkable without the availability of this remarkable material.</p> <p><strong>Q. You write that &#x201c;the paperless society we hear being bandied about so much today may not be as imminent as some people suggest.&#x201d; How so?</strong></p> <p>A. There&#x2019;s a wonderful quote I use as an epigraph to one of the chapters, an observation made in the 1980s by a historian of libraries named Jesse Shera. &#x201c;The paperless society,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;is about as probable as the paperless bathroom.&#x201d; Many functions of paper definitely are on the wane, and we all know what they are, books, newspapers, correspondence, record-keeping and the like. But those account for just a fraction of the functions that paper facilitates, currency, toilet paper, photographic prints, wrapping paper, cardboard packaging, labels, food containers &#x2013; it&#x2019;s all paper &#x2013; and I don&#x2019;t see many substitutes for those products immediately on the horizon.</p> <p><strong>Q. What role do you see paper playing in the future?</strong></p> <p>A. There&#x2019;s a company based in Pennsylvania, P. H. Glatfelter, that has more than tripled its business in barely a decade, and is now a $1.6 billion-a-year company, and they did it by diversifying to the point that they make paper for more than a thousand different commercial uses &#x2013; paper for tea bags, postage stamps, greeting cards, candy wrappers, copying machines, while also supplying high-quality paper for use in the publishing industry. The companies that are going to survive and prosper, I believe, are the companies that have the will and the perception to seek out and serve a variety of niche markets such as these.</p> <p><strong>Q. The smart phone has become our generation&#x2019;s diary, newspaper, novel, notepad, planner and so much more. What do you see as the benefits and drawbacks to this transition?</strong></p> <p>A. I think future generations may regret the absence of hard-copy diaries, journals, correspondence and the like from people living an exclusively electronic kind of life. These are artifacts that give us so much information about the way people think and how they live at a particular point in time, and to eliminate them as a resource for future scholars is a palpable loss. Think of what we would have missed if John and Abigail Adams had texted each other digitally during the years of the Revolution, and not written the kind of letters that truly span the centuries, or if their son, John Quincy Adams, had not kept a daily diary from the time he was twelve to a few days before he died in 1848 at the age of eighty. I write in my chapter on governmental red tape how the National Archives is working to develop reliable ways to insure that electronic records are stored in ways that they will be preserved permanently in standard formats, and &#x201c;readable&#x201d; to future researchers. In fact that&#x2019;s the biggest challenge professional archivists face today, the long-term conservation of &#x201c;born digital&#x201d; materials.</p><p>Nicholas A.

While the present obstacles we face may seem overwhelming, author and humane educator Zoe Weil shows us that change doesn't have to start with an army. It starts with you. Through her straightforward approaches to living a MOGO, or "most good," life, she reveals that the true path to inner peace doesn't require a retreat from the world. Rather, she gives the reader powerful and practicable tools to face these global issues, and improve both our planet and our personal lives. <br> <br> Weil explores direct ways to become involved with the community, make better choices as consumers, and develop positive messages to live by, showing readers that their simple decisions really can change the world. Inspiring and remarkably inclusive of the interconnected challenges we face today, <i>Most Good, Least Harm</i> is the next step beyond "green" -- a radical new way to empower the individual and motivate positive change.</p><p>Zoe Weil is the co-founder and president of the Institute for Humane Education (IHE). A humane educator since 1985, Zoe has been giving people the tools to make humane and sustainable choices and solve entrenched challenges through her classes, workshops, and training programs. She created the first humane education certificate program and Master of Education in Humane Education in the United States. These distance-learning programs attract students from around the world. The IHE M.Ed. program is offered through an affiliation with Cambridge College where Zoe serves on the faculty. <br> <br>Zoe speaks widely on humane education and MOGO living, and leads MOGO and Sowing Seeds Humane Education workshops around the U.S. and Canada. She is recognized as a pioneer in comprehensive humane education. <br> <br>Zoe is the author of <i>Above All, Be Kind: Raising a Humane Child in Challenging Times</i> for parents, <i>The Power and Promise of Humane Education</i> for teachers, and <i>Claude and Medea: The Hellburn Dogs</i>, a children&#x2019;s adventure book about 12-year-old activists. <br> <br>Zoe received master&#x2019;s degrees from Harvard Divinity School and the University of Pennsylvania and is certified in Psychosynthesis, a form of counseling that relies on individuals&#x2019; innate wisdom to promote health and well being. <br> <br>Zoe lives with her husband, son, and rescued dogs and cat in coastal Maine."There is deep and useful wisdom in this book. It is clean, courageous, and generous." -- John Robbins, author of <i>Diet for a New America, The Food Revolution,</i> and <i>Healthy at 100</i><br><br><i>"Most Good, Least Harm</i> is a brave, honest, important book. Zoe Weil not only teaches us how to think more comprehensively about today's critical political, environmental, and energy issues but, more important, how to act more effectively." -- Robert Shetterly, artist and author of <i>Americans Who Tell the Truth</i><br><br>"Zoe Weil is a true educator with a fund of inspiring examples, a sound moral principle, and abundant common sense. Reading <i>Most Good, Least Harm</i> -- and passing it on to others -- will do lots of good and no harm." -- Peter Singer, author of <i>Animal Liberation</i> and professor of bioethics, Princeton University<br><br><i>"Most Good, Least Harm</i> is a must read for everyone who wants to do something to make our country and the world a better place for the next generation. It is a recipe for creating a nation of responsive social heroes, who collectively can achieve the positive changes we all desire." -- Philip Zimbardo, PhD, professor emeritus, Stanford University</p><h2>Shopping, Seduction &amp; Mr. Selfridge</h2><p><b>If you lived at Downton Abbey, you shopped at Selfridge&#x2019;s.</b><br><br>Harry Gordon Selfridge was a charismatic American who, in twenty-five years working at Marshall Field&#x2019;s in Chicago, rose from lowly stockboy to a partner in the business which his visionary skills had helped to create. At the turn of the twentieth century he brought his own American dream to London&#x2019;s Oxford Street where, in 1909, with a massive burst of publicity, Harry opened Selfridge&#x2019;s, England&#x2019;s first truly modern built-for-purpose department store. Designed to promote shopping as a sensual and pleasurable experience, six acres of floor space offered what he called &#x201c;everything that enters into the affairs of daily life,&#x201d; as well as thrilling new luxuries&#x2014;from ice-cream soda to signature perfumes. This magical emporium also featured Otis elevators, a bank, a rooftop garden with an ice-skating rink, and a restaurant complete with orchestra&#x2014;all catering to customers from Anna Pavlova to Noel Coward. The store was &#x201c;a theatre, with the curtain going up at nine o&#x2019;clock.&#x201d; Yet the real drama happened off the shop floor, where Mr. Selfridge navigated an extravagant world of mistresses, opulent mansions, racehorses, and an insatiable addiction to gambling. While his gloriously&nbsp; iconic store still stands, the man himself would ultimately come crashing down.<br><br><b>The true story that inspired the Masterpiece series on PBS</b>&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b><i>Mr. Selfridge</i> is a co-production of ITV Studios and Masterpiece</b><br><br>&#x201c;Enthralling . . .

It reflects political,social and economic changes, rather than mere whimsy.&#x201d; &#x2014;Louis XIV<br><br>In 1860, as America braced itself for civil war, business-men began to stockpile goods. No one knew better than the store owners what would happen when fabric became scarce. It wasn&#x2019;t silks and satins that worried them, it was cotton&#x2014;and they fretted more about the lack of it than the picking of it. In April 1861, when war was declared and President Lincoln issued his Proclamation of Blockade, speculation in cotton became rife, and panicking Northern mill owners were only too glad to forge associations with men who promised to continue the smooth flow of supplies from South to North.<br><br>When Union forces captured New Orleans in 1862, trade through the Mississippi Valley became particularly brisk. Cotton was also moved out via Memphis and Vicksburg, all of which kept the mills working&#x2014;so much so that during the first two years of the war manufacturers still made a healthy profit. By 1863, however, supplies were dwindling and there was a short-age of men to run the machines. American spinning mills went on half-time production. As cotton goods became increasingly scarce, those who had filled a warehouse or two could name their price.<br><br>In New York, President Lincoln&#x2019;s friend Alexander Stewart, the acknowledged &#x201c;merchant prince&#x201d; of the day, made enormous sums of money, having astutely cornered the market in domestic linen as well as cotton. Given that Mary Lincoln, a woman who clearly sought security through her possessions and for whom shopping was an addiction, spent thousands of dollars at Stewart&#x2019;s Marble Palace&#x2014;on one memorable visit she ordered eighty-four pairs of colored kid gloves&#x2014;it is not surprising that Mr. Stewart was also rewarded with lucrative contracts to supply clothing to the Union army. Indeed, the war seemed to have no effect on the shopping habits of New York&#x2019;s rich. The media criticized their &#x201c;hedonistic approach during the daily slaughter wrought by the war,&#x201d; but the pursuit of fashion carried on regardless.<br><br>Chicago too enjoyed a profitable war. The small town that had emerged out of the swampy Fort Dearborn just three decades earlier&#x2014;and where some could still remember Chief Black Hawk and his warriors swooping in to attack&#x2014;was now the hub of America&#x2019;s biggest railroad network and the collecting point for food to supply both the East and the army. Awash with opportunity and swimming in cash, sprawling, still muddy, &#x201c;rough and ready&#x201d; Chicago became a boomtown. As the farm boys joined the army, production of Cyrus McCormick&#x2019;s reaping machines increased&#x2014;as did his fortune. He wasn&#x2019;t alone. Whether it was pork, which Philip Armour bought at eighteen dollars a barrel and sold for forty dollars, or luxury Pullman cars developed by the railwayman George Pullman, Chicago tycoons were making millions of dollars&#x2014;and their wives were helping them spend it.<br><br>The destination of choice for Chicago&#x2019;s shoppers was Potter Palmer&#x2019;s store on Lake Street. Palmer, who went on to become a property developer of immense skill, had started his career in Chicago in 1839 as a small-time dry-goods retailer. There was nothing small about his ambitions, however, nor his ability to judge women&#x2019;s desire to shop. He sold goods at fixed and fair prices, let his ladies take clothes home to try on, and left copies of Godey&#x2019;s Lady&#x2019;s Book (the fashion magazine of the time) in the store for browsing. Better yet, he read it himself. His maxim was &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to think big,&#x201d; and by the time war came, he had done so, stocking up on cotton goods, filling vast warehouses with everything from petticoats and pantalets to sheets and tea towels, and advertising his stock with a &#x201c;money-back guarantee&#x201d;&#x2014;a revolutionary idea at the time.<br><br>Among the men who enlisted all over the North in 1861 was Robert Oliver Selfridge. At the age of thirty-eight he left his home in Ripon, a hamlet in Wisconsin 170 miles north of Chicago, where he ran a general store, to go to war. Reputed to be a sober, hardworking man and described as &#x201c;a stalwart of local activity,&#x201d; he was also Master of the Ripon Freemasons&#x2019; Lodge. Robert Selfridge and his wife, Lois, had three young sons&#x2014;Charles Johnston, Robert Oliver Jr., and Henry Gordon (known as Harry). Though there has always been uncertainty in the Selfridge family over precise dates of birth, it seems likely that Harry was born on January 11, 1856. He was just five when his father went to war&#x2014;and never returned.<br><br>Not that Major Selfridge died in battle. He was honorably discharged in 1865, whereupon he simply vanished. No one ever knew why. Perhaps, having witnessed the carnage, he had a nervous breakdown. Perhaps he simply wanted to be free of responsibilities. Whatever the case, he left his wife to bring up her family on her own, on the meager earnings of a teacher. Harry later described Lois as &#x201c;brave, upstanding, and with indomitable courage.&#x201d; She was indeed brave, and she needed to be. Not long after the war her eldest son, Charles, died, and then her middle son, Robert. She was now left alone with young Harry.<br><br>Moving with her son to Jackson, Michigan, Lois found work as a primary-school teacher, earning around thirty dollars a month. Making ends meet was a constant struggle, so she supplemented her salary by painting Valentine and other novelty cards. Still with no word from her husband, she was left to assume that he was &#x201c;missing, presumed dead.&#x201d; Only years later did she learn that he had been killed in a railway accident in Minnesota in 1873 and that she was&#x2014;finally&#x2014;a widow. Harry was shielded from the truth, growing up believing that his father had been &#x201c;killed in battle,&#x201d; a story he would often repeat to the media. It would be years before he discovered the truth.<br><br>Hardly surprisingly, all the love Lois had left to give was centered on her young son. The two of them found genuine pleasure in each other&#x2019;s company and became such great friends that they continued to live together until the day she died. When things got bleak, they played a game called &#x201c;Suppose,&#x201d; which involved imaginary plots about success through endeavor. &#x201c;Suppose&#x201d; they could afford a cottage with a bay window? Even &#x201c;suppose&#x201d; they were able to live in a castle with lots of servants? Though a pious woman who attended church regularly and abhorred alcohol, Lois was always happy to go to a new play or concert and was an avid reader, a pleasure she imbued in her son.<br><br>Mrs. Selfridge continued her career as a teacher, becoming the headmistress of Jackson High School, where the education of the town&#x2019;s young was entrusted to her capable care. The most important thing she taught Harry was never to fear failure. She was fond of saying, &#x201c;Why should you worry about failing? There&#x2019;s always something else to try and you can excel in that instead.&#x201d; She taught Harry to be gracious. She taught him impeccable manners. Finally, she taught him the importance of appearance. She would check his fingernails in the morning and again before supper&#x2014;not that he needed much checking. From an early age Harry was fastidious, and he loved nothing better than wearing a clean shirt to school and polishing his boots until they gleamed.<br><br>When Harry wasn&#x2019;t dreaming about castles or maintaining his modest wardrobe, he had his head in a book, devouring stories by James Fenimore Cooper and Nathaniel Hawthorne, along with his favorite, Struggles and Triumphs, the well-thumbed autobiography of the great circus showman Phineas T. Barnum. The rags-to-riches story of Barnum inspired Harry to dream of a future far away from Jackson. In many respects the two were very similar. Barnum had a rare gift for publicity. His spectacular museum in New York drew the public in the thousands and he became rich by entertaining them. Like Barnum, Selfridge had the ability to suspend disbelief. His tricks&#x2014;entertaining people in a great store that was, in a way, just like a circus tent&#x2014;created such confidence among his friends, family and financial backers that for years they refused to accept that his extravagant, destructive side was gradually eroding his ability to run his business empire.<br><br>All that lay ahead. At the age of ten, Harry started to earn cash in the time-honored way, by delivering newspapers. Next he took over a bread, and finally he took a holiday job at Leonard Field&#x2019;s dry-goods store where he stocked shelves and carried parcels for $1.50 a week&#x2014;cash he promptly handed over to his mother. When he was thirteen, he and a school friend, Peter Loomis, produced a boy&#x2019;s monthly magazine called Will o&#x2019; the Wisp. Harry threw himself into the magazine, hustling for advertising from local tradesmen and promising them a &#x201c;guaranteed circulation from all the boys at school.&#x201d; Years later, Loomis recalled that &#x201c;Harry sold space to a local dentist who owed us 75 cents. When he didn&#x2019;t pay up, Harry got him to extract a troublesome tooth for free to square the debt.&#x201d; His experience of publishing Wisp not only gave Harry a lifelong passion for the business of publicity and promotion, but also introduced him to the power of the press&#x2014;something he never forgot and which he played to his advantage throughout his career.<br><br>Loomis&#x2019;s father ran a small bank in Jackson, and when Harry left school at fourteen, he got a job there as a junior bookkeeper, earning twenty dollars a month. A tough taskmaster named Mr. Potter taught him to write a neat ledger, as Harry later recalled in a letter to Loomis: &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t exactly inspire or encourage, but he did rub things in so hard that you could never forget them.&#x201d; Jotting down figures became an ingrained habit, and Harry&#x2019;s lists make fascinating reading. In just one of his silver-clasped, cream vellum private ledgers dated 1921, he noted in an immaculate hand that on June 3 he lost �1,198 playing poker and gave &#x201c;the Hon. Angela Manners �5.5/-&#x201d; (presumably a charity donation), while in July&#x2014;somewhat mysteriously for a man who owned his own department store&#x2014;he spent �476 17s. 6d. at the Irish Linen Company in the Burlington Arcade.<br><br>It has been said that at around this time Harry studied for the entrance examinations to the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, but failed his physical test because he was too short. Harry was always sensitive about his height&#x2014;he was a shade under five feet eight inches and wore lifts in his custom-made boots to give him an extra half inch&#x2014;but that fact alone wouldn&#x2019;t have prevented him joining the navy, for they required only that candidates &#x201c;be not less than five feet.&#x201d; It is more likely that he would have failed because of his eyesight. He was notoriously farsighted, and as a consequence wore glasses for all reading and writing, initially a metal-rimmed pince-nez and later thin gold frames. He had the most brilliant, clear blue eyes and would fix people with a beguiling stare that could be disconcerting to those who didn&#x2019;t realize that he could hardly see them otherwise.<br><br>Harry soon left the bank and moved to Gilbert, Ransom &amp; Knapp, a local furniture factory, where he became a bookkeeper. Unfortunately, the business was already waning and went into liquidation a few months later. Being unemployed wasn&#x2019;t an option, so he took work at a dollar a day in an insurance business in Big Rapids, a small town several hundred miles away.<br><br>Whatever influences inspired Harry Selfridge in his quest to create a seductive shopping experience, he certainly didn&#x2019;t find them in Big Rapids. He was never a fan of country pursuits, and fishing and fur trapping were pretty much all Big Rapids offered by way of recreation in those days. Neither did he drink much. What Harry enjoyed was playing cards&#x2014;especially poker&#x2014;and Big Rapids was almost certainly where he honed his game. At one point, boredom is rumored to have prompted him to study law&#x2014;via a correspondence course&#x2014;but he subsequently admitted that it was a &#x201c;complete disaster.&#x201d; In one thing, however, he remained constant. In the office he was always impeccably dressed. Years later, when Selfridge had become famous and the American press serialized his life story, an old acquaintance from Big Rapids recalled that Harry always looked &#x201c;as if he had just come out of a bandbox.&#x201d;<br><br>Harry Selfridge returned to Jackson late in 1876 with five hundred dollars he had &#x201c;saved from his earnings,&#x201d; although given his predilection for poker, it was more likely to have been the winnings from a few lucky hands at cards. He then drifted from one dreary job to another, culminating in eighteen months at a local grocery store. By the time he was twenty-two, he was desperate to move on. But how&#x2014;and to where? Salvation came through his ex-employer, Leonard Field, who was persuaded to write a letter of introduction to Marshall Field in Chicago. Marshall was the senior partner in Field, Leiter &amp; Co., one of the biggest and most successful stores in the city. Young Harry would ultimately help make it one of the most famous in America.<br><br>Selfridge used to say that his interview with Mr. Field lasted a matter of minutes and that the man was &#x201c;so cold it made him shiver.&#x201d; Terms were discussed, with Harry claiming he agreed to a weekly wage of ten dollars as a stock boy in the wholesale department basement&#x2014;but the pay at the very bottom of the ladder he determined to climb was certainly less than that.<br><br>Variously described as &#x201c;dignified and quiet,&#x201d; and so taciturn he was nicknamed &#x201c;silent Marsh,&#x201d; Field had little time for anything other than work. How a man so devoid of personality could have been so successful in the business of sales, where the ability to communicate and motivate is crucial, is a mystery. Field cared little for what he called &#x201c;frivolous methods,&#x201d; running his business the way he lived his life. Dry, humorless and puritanical, albeit always courteous, he was the antithesis of Harry Selfridge. They complemented one another, but although Selfridge worked for Field for over twenty-five years, they were never friends.<br><br>To call Marshall Field merely &#x201c;successful&#x201d; is an understatement. By 1900, his recorded annual income was $40 million a year (nearly $800 million today), and when he died in 1906, he left an estate worth $118 million (over $2 billion today). A large part of his fortune came from real estate and his early investment in railroad stocks. He was also an original and significant investor in the Pullman Company, backing George Pullman&#x2019;s imaginative concept of luxurious comfort while traveling by train. Given that the journey from Chicago to New York alone took twenty hours, it is small wonder that Pullman&#x2019;s deluxe dining car, called &#x201c;the Delmonico&#x201d; after New York&#x2019;s swell restaurant, was so successful. Only the rich could travel in his cars, while the really rich bought and customized their own private Pullman carriages&#x2014;the private jets of their day&#x2014;fitting marble bathtubs, overstuffed velvet sofas, piped organ music and, the height of one-upmanship, taking along an English butler to ensure the service was smooth.</p><h2>Into the Fire (Vatta&#39;s Peace)</h2><p><b>In this new military sci-fi thriller from the Nebula Award&#x2013;winning author of <i>Cold Welcome, </i>Admiral Kylara Vatta is back&#x2014;with a vengeance.</b><br><br> Ky beats sabotage, betrayal, and the unforgiving elements to lead a ragtag group of crash survivors to safety on a remote arctic island.

Below, she could see the brick walk bordered by low shrubs pruned into balls, the perfect green lawn, the white-painted palings and gate through which she and Rafe had entered a few hours before.<br><br>A chill draft came off the window, reminding her that she was still in the beach clothes she&#x2019;d put on before leaving Corleigh just that morning. If Stella and Helen hadn&#x2019;t arrived on Corleigh yesterday, if she and Rafe had gotten back to the mainland when they planned, it would have been warm here, too. She could almost feel the elation of the previous morning as they packed to leave the island, planning to buy their own ship and leave Slotter Key together. Her fortune, they&#x2019;d thought&#x2014;her back pay, her savings banked on Cascadia, and the money Stella owed her for the shares Ky had given up&#x2014;combined with Rafe&#x2019;s personal fortune and the stipend he had from ISC, would be enough to buy a spaceship, hire some crew, and go wherever their interests took them.<br><br>But then . . . it had all fallen apart. Stella and Helen arrived because the house&#x2014;this house&#x2014;had been attacked, a door kicked in, and Helen had feared for the children. They&#x2019;d brought the news that the money Ky had counted on to help buy a ship&#x2014;her back pay from Space Defense Force and money owed her for the sale of her shares of Vatta Transport and Vatta Enterprises&#x2014;had been sequestered by the government of Cascadia, because she was being blamed for the death of her former aide. Jen&#x2019;s father was on the Grand Council of the Moscoe Confederation. Stella&#x2019;s position on Cascadia, Vatta&#x2019;s secondary headquarters, was threatened, as well. Ky&#x2019;s own accounts here on Slotter Key were also frozen because of the deaths on Miksland. The evidence she&#x2019;d collected so carefully from the crashed shuttle and from Miksland had gone missing&#x2014;the evidence that could clear her of suspicion that she&#x2019;d murdered those who died. So much had gone wrong; probably more would.<br><br>The gray sky outside matched her mood. She felt alienated from the house, the city, the entire planet; eight years of physical separation, the attack&#x2014;she wasn&#x2019;t even sure exactly how long after she&#x2019;d left&#x2014;that killed her parents, her brothers, her uncle, Stella&#x2019;s sister and brothers. It was too different&#x2014;no, she was too different. She didn&#x2019;t fit into the Vatta family structure anymore. She didn&#x2019;t have a place in Slotter Key&#x2019;s military; she no longer had her own fleet, the fleet she had built from one old battered tradeship. The men and women she&#x2019;d commanded&#x2014;those who knew her best&#x2014;were either dead or far away, in the Space Defense Force. Her throat tightened; her stomach churned.<br><br>She took a deep breath, forcing herself to think forward and not back. She had things she could do, things that might&#x2014;though it was hard to believe&#x2014;be as interesting, as worthwhile, as what she&#x2019;d already done. First she needed to find out what had happened to the evidence she&#x2019;d brought back from Miksland, evidence that would clear her of charges of murder for every death that had occurred. Then find a way to convince the Moscoe Confederation that she had not killed Jen Bentik, so they would release the lien on her funds. And she needed to know how the other survivors from Miksland were doing. By now, they should be almost through the home leave she&#x2019;d been told about, ready to return to duty. Grace, as Rector of Defense, would be able to get their addresses for her.<br><br>And&#x2014;if she was stuck here long enough, all the way to the next southern summer, she might even return to Miksland, explore the deep levels, those mysterious laboratories, maybe even figure out who had built them. Rafe didn&#x2019;t have enough money for a spaceship, but he certainly had enough for a charter flight. Scientists were probably down there now. It would be safe, with Greyhaus&#x2019;s people far away and the mercenaries dead. Whoever had first claimed it surely wouldn&#x2019;t dare do anything now that it was public knowledge.<br><br>She looked across the street to another front garden as formal as the one below, and the white brick house behind it with its flagstone walk, its rows of shrubs pruned into little pyramids. The second floor was built out over a rounded portico, forming a curved row of windows. Handy for neighborhood snoops, if there were any.<br><br>Rain spattered the window, a swift rattle that broke into her thoughts. Across the street she saw a curtain twitch, opening a dark gap, but she couldn&#x2019;t see anyone. So there was a neighborhood snoop. Below, a black car pulled up in front of the house. Stella got out, accepted her travel case and two white containers from the driver, then tapped the code onto the front gatepost. It opened for her. Ky saw someone step out between the portico columns of the house across the street, and then disappear again. Stella waved the driver away.<br><br>Ky went back to the stairs and down in time to see Rafe open the door. A gust of cold wet air swirled in when he pulled it back.<br><br>&#x201c;I brought supper,&#x201d; Stella said. She handed the containers to Ky. &#x201c;Take these into the kitchen, please. I&#x2019;ll be back when I&#x2019;ve changed into something warmer.&#x201d;<br><br>Stella came into the kitchen a few minutes later, dressed in slacks and a pullover, looking elegant as usual. Ky wished she had asked for her own clothes to be picked up that afternoon. She set out plates on the kitchen table, opened the boxes and made a guess at who wanted which. Stella pushed the opened containers to the middle of the small table and said, &#x201c;Whatever you want.&#x201d;<br><br>After supper, eaten quickly and almost silently, they made the rounds of checking doors and windows. As Stella looked out the double glass doors into the back garden, she shook her head. &#x201c;I should have checked before supper. There&#x2019;s that miserable stuffed pony, getting wet on a swing. Justin loves it. It&#x2019;ll mildew if I don&#x2019;t get it in the dryer. And the ball looks tacky out there.&#x201d; She turned on an outside light, opened the door and went out, crossing the terrace and then the grass; Ky stayed back, away from the cold wind and rain, watching. Stella came back, raindrops in her hair sparkling in the light, the wet stuffed toy in one hand and the ball in the other. Just as she came into the house, the door chime rang and someone knocked on the front door.<br><br>&#x201c;Take these,&#x201d; Stella said, handing off the wet toys to Ky. She shut and locked the garden doors and headed toward the front. &#x201c;Dryer&#x2019;s just off the kitchen.&#x201d;<br><br>Ky had no desire to visit with company; she ducked into the short passage to the kitchen as whoever it was pounded harder on the door. Rafe, she noticed, had followed Stella. Ky found the dryer, tossed the stuffed toy into it, and stared at the dials, finally deciding on gentle. She dried the wet ball with a kitchen towel, then sat down at the kitchen table. She could just hear Stella speaking, though she could not distinguish the words. The tone made it clear Stella was upset. In a minute or so Stella was back in the kitchen, color in her pale cheeks. &#x201c;The utter nerve&#x2014;&#x201d; she was saying to Rafe, who followed her.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the problem?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, some military police or something&#x2014;not Port Major police&#x2014;said they suspected there were dangerous fugitives in the neighborhood. They wanted to search the house and grounds. I said no, that there&#x2019;d been a watchman at the house day and night. They thought the damage to the kitchen door meant someone might be hiding inside. I had to show my ID, even. Do I look like a fugitive?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; Ky said.<br><br>&#x201c;I told them to check with Port Major police about the break-in&#x2014;maybe it was the same gang they were chasing&#x2014;asked if they knew who the fugitives were, but they didn&#x2019;t answer. Just said to be careful and lock everything up. Oh, and they&#x2019;re going to be doing aerial surveillance tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We should see what&#x2019;s on the newsvids,&#x201d; Rafe said. &#x201c;Surely there&#x2019;d be something about a prison breakout.&#x201d; He led the way to the security office next to the lift and turned on another screen. A serious-faced man was explaining what cut of cattlelope to choose for braising. A streamer at the bottom carried ads for cookware shops. Rafe changed selections. Two women and three men were arguing about a recent election on Dorland and what it meant for the balance of power in the planetary legislature. Here the streamer carried what Ky recognized as financial news. Another try gave them an obvious drama vid, with a stationary block giving time, temperature, wind speed, and wave height.<br><br>&#x201c;Wrong time,&#x201d; Stella said. &#x201c;Slotter Key&#x2019;s media laws are different from Nexus or Cascadia. Much more tightly controlled.&#x201d;<br><br>Rafe switched off the screen. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go on out, then, and repel lurkers, if any.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s cold and wet,&#x201d; Stella said. &#x201c;You should change.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have nothing with me. I&#x2019;ll be fine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Backup?&#x201d; Ky said.<br><br>&#x201c;No. Stay here with Stella.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s his I&#x2019;m up to something voice,&#x201d; Stella said. &#x201c;If only they hadn&#x2019;t been so rude&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It upset him?&#x201d; Ky leaned on the wall, out of the draft coming in the door Stella held half open.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Stella looked outside again, where Rafe was a vague blur in the dark.<br><br>&#x201c;Why military police?&#x201d; Ky asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Stella said. She glanced at the kitchen door, slightly crooked in its frame and braced with a couple of boards nailed across it. &#x201c;But I hope they&#x2019;re wrong about any escaped military criminals. That boarded-up door does look like an easy place to break in.&#x201d; They watched Rafe move along the front of the shrubbery and waited for him to turn back toward the house when he reached the garage wall. Instead, he stood still.<br><br>&#x201c;Found something,&#x201d; Stella said. &#x201c;I wonder what.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Or someone,&#x201d; Ky said. She moved her pistol from her shoulder holster to the pocket of her shorts. Then Rafe turned back toward the house, walking steadily, not looking back, and behind him the first figure came out of the shrubbery. Then another. And another. They were hard to see in the rain and poor light. Ky heard Stella&#x2019;s indrawn breath, Rafe&#x2019;s sandals scuffing in the damp grass, and behind him, other footfalls, softer. He stepped onto the terrace, walked across it, his sandals slapping lightly on the bricks. He quirked an eyebrow at her. Behind him, just visible in the dim scattered glow of his handlight, she could see the first of the three following him: short and slight, a bald head paler than the brown face, wearing some kind of thin garment&#x2014;a robe?<br><br>Rafe stepped inside and walked on, turning around as the three came in: all women, Ky could see now, shivering as their wet clothes clung to them. All were bald, scalps and faces completely hairless. Were these the escaped criminals? They didn&#x2019;t look like it. Their legs were bare from well above the knees, their feet in thin, now-sodden cloth slippers. Stella shut the outside doors and pulled heavy linen curtains over them.<br><br>All three knelt, dripping on the floor. The one who had led them in said, &#x201c;Admiral, please help us. You&#x2019;re the only one who can.&#x201d;<br><br>The voice gave Ky the name. &#x201c;Inyatta?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir. Please&#x2014;don&#x2019;t turn us in&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Ky fought to keep her expression calm despite a surge of rage at what had been done to them. They did not need her rage; they needed her help.<br><br>&#x201c;Stella, lock us down,&#x201d; Rafe said.<br><br>Stella looked at Ky, at Rafe, at the three wet women who&#x2019;d been hiding in the shrubbery. &#x201c;No one can see in now. And lockdown will seal off the kitchen annex.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do it,&#x201d; Ky said. She held out her hands; Inyatta grasped them. &#x201c;Inyatta&#x2014;all of you, get up; the floor&#x2019;s cold.&#x201d; She reholstered her pistol. &#x201c;These must be who those men were hunting.&#x201d; She had not looked away from Inyatta; she heard Stella walk to the master panel and key in the code. &#x201c;Corporal, what&#x2019;s happened to you? Are the others all right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No&#x2014;and we don&#x2019;t know what, or why&#x2014;they separated us&#x2014;they changed our implants&#x2014;&#x201d; Inyatta&#x2019;s voice was shaky as she clambered up; she was shivering.<br><br>The house lights brightened and a current of warmer air moved across the room. &#x201c;Internal power and environmental confirmed,&#x201d; Stella said. &#x201c;Now what? You know these people?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. This is Corporal Inyatta; she was with me on Miksland.&#x201d; She still didn&#x2019;t recognize the other two. Ky glanced at Rafe, then back at Stella. &#x201c;We need to get them dry, warm, and fed. Then find out what&#x2019;s been going on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t send us back?&#x201d; Again, the voice gave her the identity: Corporal Barash. &#x201c;Please!&#x201d; The third had not spoken at all, and Ky hadn&#x2019;t figured out who she was yet. She had a fresh scar, a raised red-purple ridge, on her head, and puffy swelling that changed whatever her face had been.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course I won&#x2019;t. Come on upstairs. Hot baths, towels, clothes&#x2014;Stella, have you got some extra warm things? All I have is a change of shirts.&#x201d; Ky headed for the stairs. &#x201c;I trust you left nothing behind that could be noticed in the morning?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, sir. We ate the paper off the fruit bars.&#x201d; That was the third, and again the voice gave Ky the identification. Kamat&#x2014;that was Durga Kamat? The shaved head, scar, and puffiness obscured what had been an unusual beauty. What had happened to her&#x2014;to them&#x2014;and what about all the others? Questions erupted in her mind, but right now these three needed care.<br><br>Ky led them to the first of the two bedrooms on the right of the landing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m guessing you&#x2019;d like to stay together?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, please.&#x201d; They were clustered in the doorway, staring at all the flowered chintz.<br><br>&#x201c;The sofa will make another bed. The bath&#x2019;s back here&#x2014;&#x201d; She led the way. &#x201c;This should be a linen closet&#x2014;yes. Towels, robes&#x2014;ready for guests.&#x201d;<br><br>They looked worse in the brighter light, bruises and puncture marks as if they&#x2019;d had many injections, marks on wrists and ankles from restraints. Ky said nothing about that. &#x201c;Stella&#x2019;s my cousin. She and I will be looking for clothes for you, but feel free to wrap up in blankets or anything you find to get warm.&#x201d;<br><br>She kept her voice level and calm, for their sake, but when she went back into the hall, her anger shot up like a geyser, dimming her vision for an instant. All of them must have been taken, drugged, held. Separated, Inyatta had said. Probably early on, perhaps even at Pingat Base while she had been on a flight to the mainland. Who had done this to her people? And how? Why hadn&#x2019;t Great-Aunt Grace made sure the other survivors were properly taken care of? She should not have agreed to fly back separately&#x2014;she should have thought&#x2014;but too late for that. First things: take care of these three. She crossed the head of the stairs and met Stella coming back with a stack of folded clothes.</p><h2>Bird &amp; Squirrel All Tangled Up</h2><p><b>Bird and Squirrel add a new member to the adventuring team: Squirrel's daughter, BIRDIE!!!</b><br><br>When Red has to go spend the night helping Grandmole, Bird and Squirrel are put in charge of taking care of Squirrel's daughter, Birdie.

It is apparent that this opera is rising rapidly and steadily in estimation." &#x2014; Mozart, letter to his wife, October 7-8, 1791.<br>Unfortunately, his tragic death a scant two months later prevented Mozart from ever realizing the full accuracy of this observation, made a few performances after the cool reception given<i> The Magic Flute </i>at its Viennese premiere.<br>In May 1791, Mozart's friend Emanuel Schikaneder commissioned <i>The Magic Flute.</i> In keeping with the popular level of this theater, Schikaneder himself supplied Mozart with the libretto about the rescue of a good fairy's daughter from a wicked magician by a hero armed with a magic flute. After a good deal of the music was written, the composer and librettist &#x2014; both Freemasons &#x2014; grafted Masonic ideals onto the plot, transforming a simple fairy tale into a moralistic allegory and a <i>Singspiel</i> into one of the world's greatest operas.<br>This handsome, moderately priced volume, reprinted directly form an authoritative edition, will enable musicians, music students, and opera lovers to gain a fuller appreciation of Mozart's mastery of operatic language, orchestral color, and dramatic expression. A helpful feature of this edition is the inclusion of all spoken dialog, usually abbreviated in other editions.</p><p><br></p><p></p></p><p>Mozart's "fairy-tale opera" is one of the most beloved works in the repertory. It is a favorite for children's first exposure to opera as it is an enchanting work jammed with melodies that are both noble and playful. <i>The Magic Flute</i> is also one of the most problematic works in the repertory, full of staging difficulties (the hero enters, pursued by a monstrous serpent, and promptly faints--not very heroic of him) and some elements that seem unpleasantly sexist and racist to today's sensibilities. And there's the perennial malcontent who's all too eager to point out that <i>The Magic Flute</i> is not really a grand opera in any case, but a mere singspiel, with spoken dialogue and coarse comedy, no better than an operetta. And what's with all the Masonic imagery?<p> The story certainly has problems, but the score--one of Mozart's last--overcomes them all as surely as the Three Ladies scrag the serpent and Sarastro and the forces of truth and reason overcome the wicked Queen of the Night. This music has it all, from the heroic notes of Sarastro and the priests to the humor of the bird catcher Papageno. Don't overlook the wonderful ensembles of the Drei Damen and Drei Knaben; Mozart blends trios of soprano voices in a way that's undiluted magic, and that no one even came close to imitating until more than two centuries later, when Richard Strauss took the master's lessons to heart.</p><p> You can examine for yourself just how Mozart achieved his effect with this full orchestral score from Dover. It's a reprint of another publisher's out-of-copyright score (C.F. Peters of Leipzig, in this particular case); also, there's not a word of English in it once you get past Dover's title pages and the translation of the table of contents that they've thoughtfully provided. What you will get is all of the instrumental parts (note that most pianists will be unable to do much with this score!), all of the vocal parts, and acres of uncut German dialogue. Dover scores are a reasonably priced resource for singers, instrumentalists, conductors, and anyone who cares deeply about the opera.</p>The ultimate gift for opera lovers, the irresistible illustrated libretto pairs Davide Pizzigoni&#39;s engaging images with J. D. McClatchy&#39;s witty new translation and a music CD of the rare 1937 recording of Arturo Toscanini conducting the Vienna Philharmonic.</p><h2>Saint Hyacinth of Poland</h2><p>The story for children 10 and up of St. Hyacinth, the Dominican who planted the Faith in Poland, Lithuania and Russia and worked many miracles. He went to Rome, where he met St. Dominic, and was one of the first to receive at his hands the habit of the newly established Order of Friars Preachers. After his novitiate he made his religious profession, and was made superior of the little band of missionaries sent to Poland to preach.

The heart of the book lies in its presentation of the three schools of counseling theory that Culbertson finds most helpful: family systems theory, narrative counseling theory, and object relations theory. Each of these is explained in detail, and then applied to the most common and challenging of counseling situations: pre-marital counseling, marriage counseling, divorce counseling, counseling gay men and women, and grief counseling. Culbertson brings new sensitivities to the counseling scene-a more nuanced grasp of gender, a new sense of families, issues of sexual orientation, a strong sense of the relationship of emotions to spirituality, an empathetic attitude, a pragmatic but professional mix of ancillary theories, and a sense of the relevance of the counselor&#39;s own self-understanding.</p><p>Philip Culbertson, an Episcopal priest for more than twenty-seven years, teaches pastoral care and counseling at St. John&#39;s Theological College in New Zealand.</p><h2>Latinx: The New Force in American Politics and Culture</h2><p><b>The Latinx revolution in US culture, society, and politics</b><p>&#x201c;Latinx&#x201d; (pronounced &#x201c;La-teen-ex&#x201d;) is the gender-neutral term that covers one of the largest and fastest growing minorities in the United States, accounting for 17 percent of the country. Over 58 million Americans belong to the category, including a sizable part of the country&#x2019;s working class, both foreign and native-born. Their political empowerment is altering the balance of forces in a growing number of states. And yet Latinx barely figure in America&#x2019;s ongoing conversation about race and ethnicity. Remarkably, the US census does not even have a racial category for &#x201c;Latino.&#x201d;</p><p>In this groundbreaking discussion, Ed Morales explains how Latinx political identities are tied to a long Latin American history of mestizaje&#x2014;&#x201c;mixedness&#x201d; or &#x201c;hybridity&#x201d;&#x2014;and that this border thinking is both a key to understanding bilingual, bicultural Latin cultures and politics and a challenge to America&#x2019;s infamously black&#x2013;white racial regime.

Here they hoped to finally have rich farmland and the freedom to worship freely - far from the greedy landlords of their native Ireland and the partisan rules of Quaker Pennsylvania. Mary and her family were industrious and strong, quickly learning skills to survive on the frontier. In 1750, at the age of seventeen, Mary Draper married twenty-year old Will Ingles, the first wedding of two white settlers in the region. As more Europeans moved into the area, tension between the settlers and the Native Americans increased. Raids and killings by both sides became common. One day while the men were at harvest, a band of Shawnee warriors stormed Draper&#39;s Meadow, killing some settlers and burning the settlement to the ground. Taken captive were Mary, pregnant with her third child, her two young sons, and her injured sister-in-law. Through intuition and courage Mary impressed her kidnappers almost immediately. The captives were marched 800 miles over mountains to a Shawnee village on the Ohio River, presumably to spend the rest of their lives among the Shawnee tribe. But Mary vowed to escape and return to her husband and her people. The story of this remarkable woman&#39;s harrowing and courageous trip home places Mary Ingles at the pinnacle of American frontier heroes.</p><p><p>Gr 5-8-In 1755, Mary Draper Ingles, her two sons, and her sister-in-law were taken from their Shenandoah Valley home by a band of Shawnee Indians. Ingles was expecting her third child at the time of her capture. Her mother and her sister-in-law's baby were murdered in the raid. Furbee begins with the Draper family's move to this largely unsettled area. Some of the hardships and setbacks endured over time, Mary's eventual marriage to Will Ingles, and the political climate that helped shape their experience are described. Then comes the raid that led to her capture, her time in captivity, her daring escape, and her 800-mile journey back home. Some of the reasons for the conflicts between the Native Americans and the white settlers are also presented. The workmanlike text tries hard to avoid biased language, although Furbee does not shrink from reflecting the attitudes toward Native Americans held by Ingles, her family, and friends. Fairly gruesome events are described, but they are neither sensationalized nor glossed over. The narrative does present the subject's feelings and thoughts from time to time, but conversations are held to a minimum and the effect is to lend texture to what might have otherwise been a rather dry text. The result is both a readable biography of a daring frontier woman and a snapshot of life in pre-Revolutionary America. It's not an essential purchase, but collections needing biographies of women pioneers or stories of Colonial America might consider it.</p><p><i>Linda Greengrass, Bank Street College Library, New York City</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Gr. 5-8. Mary's Scotch-Irish family heads to western Virginia in 1745, looking for opportunity. Skirmishes with Native Americans erupt as more and more settlers push west, and the thought of violence is never far from the family as it struggles to build a new life in the wilderness. Tragedy strikes when Mary is a young mother, pregnant with her third child. Shawnee creep into the homestead, murder Mary's mother and infant niece, and haul off the survivors into captivity. Terrified for herself and small sons, Mary grimly endures the ordeal, which takes her hundreds of miles from home. In a moment of desperation while living with the Shawnee, after being separated from her sons, Mary slips away. She leaves her newborn daughter behind and begins, with another woman captive, the agonizing journey home. The travelers nearly starve during the trek but, amazingly, reach their destination alive. Furbee liberally assigns motives to the captors at times, but the lively narrative of this high-action true tale flows from page one and will capture interest.

At first, Ushio is oblivious to her heart's desire, and Sumika is unwilling to reveal her own feelings, but with new friends complicating their daily lives, they are forced to reevaluate themselves. Gradually, their revelations, coupled with genuine bonding moments, bring them much closer. Character forms morph frequently to visually match the tone of the situation; poignant moments are shaded and highlighted in comparison to the normal gently cute mode, while comedic scenes are simplified and exaggerated. By keeping such elements as happiness and sadness, tension and lightness balanced, the author delivers a well-rounded emotional experience. A few hiccups in the text do not detract from the work. This shoujo-ai (light girls love) is a pure-hearted romance with minimal fanservice that establishes itself as a female friendly environment.

Here are salutes, elegies, thank-you notes, and love letters to records such as The Rolling Stones&#39; Beggars Banquet, The Ramones&#39; Rocket to Russia, Captain Beefheart&#39;s Trout Mask Replica, Something Else by the Kinks, and out-of-print classics by the Ronettes, Little Willie John, and Huey &#34;Piano&#34; Smith; the whole is supplemented with Marcus&#39;s own invaluably annotated fifty-page discography, a &#34;Treasure Island&#34; of rock and roll. Stranded remains a classic of rock and roll literature, and perhaps the best possible answer to the question: what one rock and roll book would you take to a desert island?</p><h2>Aunt Dimity Down Under (Aunt Dimity Mystery)</h2><p><b>Lori Shepherd travels to New Zealand in Aunt Dimity's fifteenth charming adventure.

Even though our thoughts might be with them, we lack the confidence to reach out, worrying that we will say or do the "wrong" thing. <br><br> In this practical, step-by-step guide to what she calls "the art of comforting," Val Walker draws on numerous interviews with "Master Comforters" to guide readers in gently and gracefully breaking through the walls that those who are suffering often erect around themselves. Interviewees include inspiring individuals such as Alicia Rasin, who, as a victim's advocate for the city of Richmond, Virginia, has devoted her life to comforting grieving families devastated by homicide, gang violence, and other traumatic experiences; or Patricia Ellen, who, as a grief counselor and outreach director at the Center for Grieving Children in Portland, Maine, appears on site to support and comfort children, staff, and parents when a school is facing a death, violence, or other crises. <br><br> All of us will, at one time or the other, be called upon to offer warmth and support to another human being who is suffering-this book will show you how to answer the call with an open heart.</p><p>I wrote the book I could not find.&nbsp;<b>Val Walker </b>received her MS in rehabilitation counseling from Virginia Commonwealth University and is a rehabilitation and bereavement consultant.

Mac didn't remember night falling, but when he became deeply immersed in painting, time passed swiftly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was also cold, his fire having died to a glow of coals. Lamps glowed softly, which meant his valet, Bellamy, must have entered and lit them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mac pulled himself out of the painting of a Scottish landscape and restored himself to the here and now. It was mid-December, at two in the morning, and his wife and children were snugly asleep in the floors below. Mac's brothers and their families slept in their wings of the vast house, all awaiting the celebrations at Christmas and Hogmanay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No one should be up near the studio at this hour, but that did not mean his son, Robert, hadn't climbed restlessly out of bed to roam the halls. Or that Robert and his cousins Jamie and Alec hadn't gathered for a stolen smoke or nip of whisky they didn't think their fathers knew about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mac wiped his brush and dropped it into his jar of oil of turpentine. He mopped at his hands, which never stayed clean, but didn't bother trying to scrub off his face. Nor did he remove the kerchief that kept his hair more or less free of paint. Once he found the source of the noise, he'd return and finish the shadowing that was challenging him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He shrugged on his shirt, now noticing the cold. Painting with fervor heated his body, so he usually ended up in only his kilt and shoes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mac stepped into the cold, silent hall. It ran narrowly before him, ending in a T-one direction led to Ian's wing, the other to Cameron's. He saw a flutter of white in the shadows, heard again the quiet rustle that had cut through his painting haze.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Iz?" Mac called softly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He started down the corridor. If Isabella, his darling wife, had come up to entice him to bed, he'd play along. The studio had a wide, comfortable sofa, and he could build up the fire to keep them warm while they bared more skin . . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another flutter, then silence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mac began to grin. Isabella had a teasing streak, and when she turned playful, life became splendid. Mac's blood warmed, and he forgot all about painting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Izzy, love." He started after her, anticipation building. What game would she play this time? And how would Mac turn the tables, as he loved to do?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He reached the split in the corridor. Stairs led down from here to the floors below, or he could turn to one of his brothers' wings. Years ago, the sons and daughters of the Mackenzies had slept in nurseries on these top floors, but they had long since moved to larger bedchambers below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That fact was in one way sad, but then again, the older children would be marrying in a few short years, and nurseries would fill again. Mac's adopted daughter, Aimee, was nineteen now, and so beautiful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which was very worrying. Mac found himself snarling like a bear at gentlemen she danced with at the balls Isabella had carefully selected since Aimee's debut.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An icy draft poured over him as he tried to decide which way to turn. The wind cut, making him shiver. Who had left a blasted window open?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He thought the chill came from Cam's wing, and he quietly moved that direction. The short hall beyond was empty and dark.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What the devil are you doing, love?" he said, a bit louder. "It's freezing. Let's go to the studio and make it cozy."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another rustle. Mac followed the noise around the corner to the longer corridor. At its end was a flash of white, then nothing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mac gave up stealth and sprinted down the corridor. He'd catch Isabella and she'd laugh, then he'd carry her to where they could tear off what little clothing Mac wore and enjoy themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A window lay at the end of the hall-open, Mac saw as he reached it. As he'd suspected. Mac slammed it closed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He heard a whisper of sound and spun around. Behind him, where he'd just come from, stood a lady in white. A chance moonbeam caught on her red hair.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In that instant, Mac knew this wasn't Isabella. Different stance, different height, and Isabella was . . . alive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why he thought this woman wasn't, Mac didn't know. Maybe because the moonlight made her skin deathly pale, or because the white dress floated, though the draft had gone. Mac couldn't see every detail of her, but she seemed to have no hands or feet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mac's heart beat faster, but he felt no fear. Kilmorgan was an old place-this could be any lady, from any era.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Good evening," he said softly. "I'm Mac. But you probably know that. What's your name, lass? Which one are you?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The apparition was utterly silent. Mac took a step forward, wondering what would happen when he reached her. Could he walk straight through her? And would that be impolite?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was halfway down the hall to the hovering lady when she vanished, abruptly and utterly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Clouds slid over the moon. Mac was left in the freezing cold and dark, alone, disappointed, and suddenly tired.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He moved quickly back to his own wing, doused the lights in the studio, and fled downstairs to his bedchamber, which was warm and inviting. His wife was fast asleep in their bed, and never moved when Mac climbed in with her, spooning close to her in their heated nest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>�I saw a ghost last night,� Mac announced at the breakfast table.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ian Mackenzie took a moment to decide whether this declaration was interesting enough for him to look up from the letter and photographs that had arrived in the morning's post. Mac liked to spin yarns, and Ian had learned to ignore most of them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He glanced at Mac, who slid into a place at the long table, his plate loaded with eggs, sausages, ham, and scones dripping with butter. A few rivulets of butter trickled over the edge of the plate to make perfect round pools on the tablecloth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Their nephew Daniel laughed. "Did you, Uncle Mac?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I did," Mac answered without worry. "Vanished before my eyes."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Violet, Daniel's wife, made sure their seven-year-old daughter, Fleur, wasn't giving too many bits of toast to the dogs, and leaned forward eagerly. "Interesting. Where did you see it?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"My wing. Then it floated to Cam's wing and disappeared." Mac shoved most of a scone into his mouth and chewed noisily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ian had difficulty knowing when Mac was teasing or serious. Hart and Cameron were straightforward with their speeches-sometimes loudly so-but Mac made up stories or played with words, bursting out laughing in the middle of them. Ian had learned to wait until Mac wound down to judge whether what he spoke was truth or exaggeration. He returned to his letter and let the others at the table play it out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Breakfast at Kilmorgan was an informal meal, with food placed on the sideboard for all to enjoy. Some days the ladies indulged in breakfast in bed, but most mornings they made their way to the dining room to eat with the family. The younger Mackenzies were welcome-no banishment because they had not yet reached a specific age. The four brothers had made that decision years ago.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ian liked the breakfast gatherings. He read his letters or newspapers while various Mackenzies chattered around him. At the house he shared with Beth and his three children, breakfast could be intimate or rowdy, the five of them crammed around the table.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As soon as Mac ceased speaking and began to eat, Ian's daughters, Belle and Megan, entered and helped themselves at the sideboard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Megan finished filling her plate first and took a seat next to Ian. Megan was thirteen now, and becoming so beautiful. Ian lost himself in looking at her eyes, so like her mother's, and her hair that was glossy brown with a touch of red.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Belle, her plate heaped almost as much as Mac's, sat on the other side of her sister. Ian noted they kept to the placement that was usual at home-they knew he preferred it if everyone sat in the same seats day after day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Good morning, ladies," Daniel boomed at them. "Uncle Mac has seen a ghost at the top of Kilmorgan Castle. What awful specter haunts our midst? A Highlander of old, calling to his clan? Great-great-great-grandfather Malcolm bellowing for his whisky? A lady waiting for her lover to return from one of our many rebellions?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Papa." Fleur shook her head at him. Like Violet, she was a skeptic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Megan shivered. "I hope it's not the lonely lady."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Belle scoffed. "There are no ghosts. They are seen only by people who are drunk or mad." She caught Mac's grin and flushed. "Not that I mean you are mad, Uncle Mac. Or drunk. But it has been shown that oil of turpentine and the components of paints can make one's brain behave as though it is intoxicated. You might have breathed in too much last night."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mac winked at her. "An excellent theory. Very scientific. I assure you, dear niece, I keep plenty of air flowing through my studio and avoid a buildup of fumes. I truly did see a ghost. Kilmorgan is quite haunted."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Poppycock," Belle said, but Megan shivered again. "There has been absolutely no proven existence of ghosts and spirits," Belle went on. "Those who pretend to have gathered evidence are frauds. Oh, I beg your pardon, Cousin Violet."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No need, sweetheart," Violet answered calmly. "I know all about frauds and hoaxes. Do not worry, Megan. Whatever your uncle Mac saw, it wasn't a ghost."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"If you say so," Mac said before he fell to devouring the rest of his breakfast.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Megan did not return the smile, from which Ian deduced she was not reassured. He reached over and squeezed her hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"There are no ghosts," he said firmly. "They do not exist."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Quite right," Belle said on Megan's far side.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Belle looked for rational and scientific explanations for everything, from a flower pushing through the earth to how far away the stars were, to how rain clouds formed. Her inquisitive and eager mind had worked through most of the books in Ian's library, and she'd quickly absorbed everything her brother's tutors had taught them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jamie, Ian's oldest, had gone off to Harrow, leaving his sisters behind, but Ian had insisted they hire another tutor, one who could keep up with Belle's swift mind. She was determined to go to university, to study to be a doctor. Ian saw no reason why she should not-Belle was brilliant and ought to be allowed to do anything she wanted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beth tried to explain to Ian and Belle that education for a woman was very difficult, but Belle only furrowed her brow and said she'd do it. Ian knew she would, and he'd certainly use all his might as a Mackenzie to ensure that she found a university that would take her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Megan was no less intelligent, but in a different way. She was highly imaginative, constructing entire worlds in her mind and acting them out with her dolls or the dogs. Where Belle made her way through scientific journals, Megan read fairy tales and lengthy novels. Megan was also quite musical, able, like Ian, to learn a piece of music by hearing others play it through once. Unlike Ian, though, Megan could play it back with feeling, often ending up sobbing by the close of the piece.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Megan was compassionate; Belle a force to be reckoned with. Beth expressed surprise that the two got along so well, but Belle was Megan's defender, and Megan's gentleness eased Belle when she grew frustrated and impatient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What is this talk of ghosts?" Isabella Mackenzie floated into the room, her red hair drawn up in the latest fashion, which Ian privately thought resembled a giant pincushion. Isabella changed her hair nearly every week.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mac rose from the table, wiped his mouth, and kissed his wife soundly on the lips. "Saw one. Upstairs last night."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"How exciting." Isabella helped herself to toast and tea from the sideboard, sat down, and raised her cup to her lips. "Tell me all about it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mac launched into his tale once more, and Ian returned to his letter. He'd written to a man in London, asking for particulars on what was in the photographs and line drawings-an antique necklace with intricately worked loops of gold and hung with emeralds and lapis lazuli. It was ancient, Roman, and had purportedly been taken from the tomb of a Roman consul's wife. Somehow it had ended up in the treasury of a church in Norwich, and when the parish needed to raise money, they'd decided to sell it, as it was nonecclesiastical and had been hidden away for a rainy day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They'd sold it to a small museum in London that hadn't really been able to afford it, and the necklace hadn't proved a great attraction, giant fossil bones being more interesting to the museum's patrons. The museum had quietly sold it on to a collector in Paris.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ian had decided the necklace would look perfect on Beth, and wanted it for her Hogmanay present.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was a problem, however. The necklace had disappeared after the sale, and no one knew where it was. Ian, with the determination Belle had inherited from him, set out to find it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The letter, from a London acquaintance who'd photographed the piece when it had lain in the museum, confessed he did not know where the necklace had ended up. The Frenchman who'd purchased it claimed it had never reached his Parisian mansion. Somewhere between London and Paris, the necklace had vanished.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ian read the words, studied the man's photographs and drawings of the necklace, and made up his mind that nothing would deter him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Excellent," Isabella said. "Once we trap it, we'll know whether it is a true ghost or someone playing tricks on poor, sleepless Mac."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ian looked up. "Trap it?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes indeed." Isabella's green eyes sparkled as she gave Ian her wide smile. "We're off to catch a ghost."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Poor thing," Megan said, her mouth turning down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It's only someone playing tricks," Belle said. "You'll see. We'll catch them and give them a good talking-to."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Poor thing," Megan repeated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ian squeezed Megan's hand again and slid one of the photographs toward her. "I'm going to find this for your mama," he said. "Will you help me?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jamie Mackenzie spent the miles on the train from London looking through the answers to his inquiries in disappointment.</p></p><h2>The Winged Seed: A Remembrance (American Readers Series)</h2><p><p>"It has true spiritual importance for contemporary American literature."&#x2014;Edward Hirsch</p><p>Upon its initial publication, acclaimed poet Li-Young Lee's memoir <i>The Winged Seed: A Remembrance</i> (1995), received an American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation. In lyrical prose, Lee's extraordinary story begins in the 1950s when his parents fled China's political turmoil for Indonesia. Along with many other Chinese members of the population, his family was persecuted under President Sukarno. Falsely accused and charged for crimes against the state, his father spent a year and a half in jail as a political prisoner, half of that time in a leper colony. While his entire family was being transported to a prison colony, they escaped and fled to Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, and back to Hong Kong where his father rose to prominence as an evangelical preacher. Eventually, the family sought asylum in the United States in 1962. When the author was six, they emigrated to a small town in western Pennsylvania where his father became a Presbyterian minister. This reissued edition contains a new foreword by the author and never-before-seen photos of the family from different stages of their journey.</p><p><b>Li-Young Lee</b> is the author of four critically acclaimed books of poetry that have garnered such awards as the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Award from New York University; the 1990 Lamont Poetry Selection; the Writer's Award from the Mrs. Giles Whiting Foundation; and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, The Lannan Foundation, and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.</p><br></p><p>Li-Young Lee is the author of four critically acclaimed books of poetry, his most recent being <i>Behind My Eyes</i> (W.W. Norton, 2008). His earlier collections are <i>Book of My Nights</i> (BOA Editions, 2001); <i>Rose</i> (BOA, 1986), winner of the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Award from New York University; <i>The City in Which I Love You</i> (BOA, 1991), the 1990 Lamont Poetry Selection; and a memoir entitled <i>The Winged Seed: A Remembrance</i> (Simon and Schuster, 1995), which received an American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation. Lee's honors include fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, The Lannan Foundation, and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, as well as grants from the Illinois Arts Council, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. In 1988 he received the Writer's Award from the Mrs. Giles Whiting Foundation. He is also featured in Katja Esson's documentary, Poetry of Resilience.<br><br>Born in 1957 of Chinese parents in Jakarta, Indonesia, Lee learned early about loss and exile. His great grandfather was China's first republican President; and his father, a deeply religious Christian, was physician to Communist leader Mao Tse-Tung. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Lee's parents escaped to Indonesia. In 1959, his father, after spending a year as a political prisoner in President Sukarno's jails, fled Indonesia with his family to escape anti-Chinese sentiment. After a five-year trek through Hong Kong, Macau, and Japan, they settled in the United States in 1964.<br><br>Through the observation and translation of often unassuming and silent moments, the poetry of Li-Young Lee gives clear voice to the solemn and extraordinary beauty found within humanity. By employing hauntingly lyrical skill and astute poetic awareness, Lee allows silence, sound, form, and spirit to emerge brilliantly onto the page. His poetry reveals a dialogue between the eternal and the temporal, and accentuates the joys and sorrows of family, home, loss, exile, and love. In The City In Which I love You,&#x201d; the central long poem in his second collection, Li-Young Lee asks, Is prayer, then, the proper attitude / for the mind that longs to be freely blown, / but which gets snagged on the barb / called world, that / tooth-ache, the actual?&#x201d; Anyone who has seen him read will add that Lee is also one of the finest poetry readers alive.<br><br>He lives in Chicago with his wife Donna and their two sons.An autobiography at once intimate and sweeping, this work traces the path followed by poet Lee (Rose, BOA Editions, dist. by Consortium, 1986, and The City in Which I Love You, BOA Editions, dist. by Consortium, 1990) and his family. Born into a prominent Chinese family in residence in Jakarta, Lee was shaped by his scholarly father's imprisonment under the virulently anti-Chinese Sukarno; the family odyssey began when they escaped from Indonesia. His father eventually became a preacher in Hong Kong, with his final calling in a church in rust-belt Pennsylvania. Lee interweaves remembrances of incidents from his childhood with dreams, myths, his father's sermons (dimly remembered), and mundane recollections, such as the seeds in his father's coat pocket or the coconut oil in his Indonesian nanny's hair. To the son, the powerful father figure embodied cruelty, Christian kindness, inspiration, deprivation, devotion, and penetrating insight. In this lyrical yet stark rendering of a family of modern China, we see the inner development of the author from his childhood in the 1950s to the present and his adaptation to new world and new perceptions of reality.

While their designs respond to some of Britain&#x2019;s wildest and most stirring landscapes, inside many were equipped with the latest domestic technology and boasted opulent decoration and furnishings from the smartest London and Parisian firms. &nbsp;A good number survive little altered in their original state, and some are still owned by descendants of the families that built them.<br><br>Images from the famous <i>Country Life</i> Picture Library and specially commissioned photographs evoke the dramatic settings and arresting detail of these houses, making the book as appealing to decorators and architectural historians as it is to travelers and sportsmen.</p><p><b>Mary Miers</b> commutes between her home in the Scottish Highlands and England, where she works as the Fine Arts and Books Editor for <i>Country Life</i> magazine.

Economic outcomes, it is claimed, are best left to the &#x201c;invisible hand&#x201d; of the market. Yet these claims remain staunchly unsettled. The view taken in this important new book is that the omnipresence of uncertainty makes money and government essential features of any market economy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Since Adam Smith, classical economics has espoused nonintervention in markets. The Great Depression brought Keynesian economics to the fore, but stagflation in the 1970s brought a return to small-state orthodoxy. The 2008 global financial crash should have brought a reevaluation of that stance; instead the response has been punishing austerity and anemic recovery. This book aims to reintroduce Keynes&#x2019;s central insights to a new generation of economists, and embolden them to return money and government to the starring roles in the economic drama that they deserve.</p><p><b>Robert Skidelsky</b> is emeritus professor of political economy at the University of Warwick.

The first, "American Blue," takes in the U.S.'s post- '60s history alongside Alexander's child-, student- and adult-hood (with stops at Ellington/Strayhorn's '40s, Monk's '50s and a dream of Krishna along the way). A selection from a larger series titled "Ars Poetica" covers the ways poetry confronts history: " 'Poetry,' I shouted, 'Poetry,'/ I screamed, 'Poetry,/ changes none of that/ by what it says/ or how it says, none./ But a poem is a living thing/ ... and as life/ it is all that can stand/ up to violence.' " "Amistad," the third section, channels the black Atlantic convincingly, while the last section, "American Sublime," consists of just two short lyrics; the latter ends "light that carries/ possibility, illuminates,// but can promise nothing but itself." This collection makes similarly restrained promises and delivers lucidly. <i>(Oct. 1)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But such sternly moralistic tales comprise only a small part of this collection of 200-plus stories drawn from Eastern European, Middle Eastern and North African sources; others transcend their genre time after time with passion, magic and humor that reach out to people of all faiths. The book also includes a brilliant afterword by Sadeh, who muses on how folktales are born and offers cogent analyses of stories he finds particularly significant. In his superb explication of "The Shepherd's Pipe," for example, he shows how each tiny detail in this very brief story is redolent of symbolism, the pipe itself summoning up images of the various trees immortalized in the great religions, "rising upward from the earth to speak of and to man's soul." Sadeh's insights make one wish he could have devoted more space to interpreting each of these wondrous folktales.

Hector Brennan was a young GI who fled the petty tragedies of his small town to serve his country. When the war ended, their lives collided at a Korean orphanage, where they vied for the attention of Sylvie Tanner, a beautiful yet deeply damaged missionary.<br><br>As Lee masterfully unfurls the stunning story of June, Hector, and Sylvie, he weaves a profound meditation on the nature of heroism and sacrifice, the power of love, and the possibilities for mercy, salvation, and surrendering oneself to another.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Chang-Rae Lee on <em>The Surrendered</em></strong> <br><br> The inspiration for <em>The Surrendered</em> has its roots in a project I worked on more than twenty years ago, while I was still in college. I was taking a seminar on modern Korean history, and I decided that I would conduct an interview with my father to fulfill the writing assignment, conceiving a reporter-at-large-type piece that would offer personal testimony and narrative set against a historical backdrop. I wasn't sure if he would agree. My father was twelve years old on the eve of the Korean War, and although over the years I had asked him a number of times about his experiences, his responses were typically vague and hurried; he never seemed to want to talk about that time, only briefly mentioning that his sister had died during the war from an untreated bout of pneumonia. But since I was taking a course with a special focus on Korea, he agreed to speak in more detail about that period. <br><br> My father's family was originally from Pyongyang, now the capital of North Korea, and they had joined the throngs of refugees who were heading south in an attempt to get behind the line of American forces. He first recounted a story about his favorite older cousin, who was pregnant and just about to give birth as the rest of the extended family was frantically packing up and leaving. My father was dispatched to tell his cousin that everyone was departing&#x2014;explosions could be heard in the distance&#x2014;yet even though she and her husband desperately wanted to go, she had already started her labors. She couldn&#x2019;t be moved. Everybody soon left, and that was last time the cousin and her husband were seen alive; to this day no one knows what happened to them, whether they perished or survived the war and ended up living in North Korea. <br><br> Telling that story of his cousin seemed to break the grip of something on my father. He recounted again that his sister had died of pneumonia during the refugee march, then added, casually, that in fact his younger brother had died during their travels, too. This disclosure surprised me. I knew that he had lost a brother, this from asking him, as children often will, about how many siblings he had, matching the number against my uncles and aunts, but I remembered his saying that his brother had died in a "subway accident." I didn't think there was a subway in either Pyongyang or Seoul during his childhood, so I asked him when his brother had died, and how. <br><br> My father told me that in fact his brother had been killed not by a subway car but by a boxcar of a train full of refugees. They were among the hundreds who filled the cars. The car holding the rest of their family was packed tight, so he and his brother had to sleep on top of the boxcar. In the middle of the night the train halted violently, and his brother, who was eight years old, fell off, the train then lurching forward for a short distance. My father jumped down and went back and found his brother, whose leg had been amputated by the wheels of the train. My father carried him back to the car, to the rest of their family, as the blood&#x2014;and his life&#x2014;ran out of him. <br><br> I've been haunted by that story since I heard it, not only by the horror of the accident but also by the picture of my father as a boy, a boy who had to experience his brother's death so directly and egregiously. I was struck, too, by how unperturbed my father had always seemed to me, this cheerful, optimistic man who certainly didn't appear to be haunted by anything. But of course this was not quite true. The events of the war had stayed with him, and always would. <br><br> In recent years I began to consider writing a novel about that time, and what happened to my father and his brother kept coming back to me. I finally decided to try to write that scene, wondering whether a larger story might be instituted. Naturally the details changed quite drastically as I began to write, the story expanding in every direction, developing its own world and aims, and soon enough it was not my father's story at all. But the kernel of what had happened grew to become the first chapter of <em>The Surrendered</em>, which for me is not so much a war novel as it is a story concerned with the effects of mass conflict on the human psyche and spirit, the private odysseys that those who have experienced conflict must endure.<br> <p>(Photo of Chang-Rae Lee � David Burnett)</p> <br>Chang-rae Lee is the author of <i>Native Speaker</i>, winner of the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award for first fiction, <i>A Gesture Life</i>, and <i>Aloft</i>.

In <i>Holy Living,</i> he writes with profound perception about the life of holiness to which we are called. The range of Williams&#x2019; frame of reference is astonishing--he brings poets and theologians to his aid, he writes about the Rule of St Benedict, the Bible, Icons, contemplation, St Teresa of Avila and even R. D. Laing. He concludes with two chapters on the injunction "Know Thyself" in a Christian context. Throughout, Williams points out that holiness is a state of being--it is he writes "completely undemonstrative and lacking any system of expertise. It can never be dissected and analysed."</p></p><p>A former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams is now Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge.

Written with warmth and energy, it describes the history of icons and examines why they&#x2019;ve been a spiritual tool for so many centuries. Written from a uniquely Western perspective, the book guides artists&#x2013;from novices to professionals&#x2013;through the process of icon painting, using traditional techniques but employing contemporary materials. Included are eight full-color plates of the artist&#x2019;s icons.</p></p><p>Peter Pearson is a well-known American iconographer. Through his workshops and seminars, he has worked with more than 2,000 students. A former Benedictine monk, he now serves as a priest in the Episcopal Diocese of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.Icon writer (that's fancy church-speak for "painter of icons") Pearson taps into Western Christians' recent interest in icons&#x2014;but rather than writing yet another introductory book that explains what icons are, when they originated or how to pray with them, Pearson wants to help readers create them. (Well, okay: in the first chapter, Pearson rehearses the history of icons and ruminates about praying with them, but then he gets down to brass tacks.) Chapter two lists the supplies people need to write an icon and explains how to prepare the panels. Pearson then discusses steps like drawing, applying gold leaf and adding an outer border. After describing the different types of icon styles&#x2014;Byzantine, Russian, Coptic, contemporary&#x2014;Pearson walks readers through the steps for making icons of Christ's head and shoulders, the Mother of God and Saint Nicholas. Practical tips abound: avoid "fast drying" varnish, and if readers want to "communicate gold cloth," they should start with an earthy-orange or red base color. An appendix lists shops and Web sites where readers can obtain supplies, and a glossary will help them remember the difference between an iconodule and an iconostasis. Helpful illustrations round out the book. This is a fabulous resource&#x2014;practical, spiritual and fun. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There you can see remnants of the shops and churches where, amid the violence and humiliation of segregation, men and women gathered to build a remarkable community. William Sturkey introduces us to both old-timers and newcomers who arrived in search of economic opportunities promised by the railroads, sawmills, and factories of the New South. He also takes us across town and inside the homes of white Hattiesburgers to show how their lives were shaped by the changing fortunes of the Jim Crow South.</p><p>Sturkey reveals the stories behind those who struggled to uphold their southern &#x201c;way of life&#x201d; and those who fought to tear it down&#x2015;from William Faulkner&#x2019;s great-grandfather, a Confederate veteran who was the inspiration for the enigmatic character John Sartoris, to black leader Vernon Dahmer, whose killers were the first white men ever convicted of murdering a civil rights activist in Mississippi. Through it all, <i>Hattiesburg</i> traces the story of the Smith family across multiple generations, from Turner and Mamie Smith, who fled a life of sharecropping to find opportunity in town, to Hammond and Charles Smith, in whose family pharmacy Medgar Evers and his colleagues planned their strategy to give blacks the vote.</p></p><p>William Sturkey is Assistant Professor of History at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he teaches courses on African American history and the history of the American South. His first book, <i>To Write in the Light of Freedom</i>, coedited with Jon Hale, brought together the newspapers, essays, and poems produced by young black students of the Freedom Schools during the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964.&#x201c;Illuminating... Sturkey&#x2019;s clear-eyed and meticulous book pulls off a delicate balancing act. While depicting the terrors of Jim Crow, he also shows how Hattiesburg&#x2019;s black residents, forced to forge their own communal institutions, laid the organizational groundwork for the civil rights movement of the &#x2019;50s and &#x2019;60s.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Hattiesburg is where racial democracy meets white supremacy, where technology meets nature, where old slavery money meets the indebted sharecropper, where imagination meets the unimaginable, where the ballot meets the bullet. Sturkey&#x2019;s magnificent portrait reminds us that Mississippi is no anachronism. It is the dark heart of American modernity.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robin D. G. Kelley, author of <i>Thelonious Monk: The Life and Times of an American Original</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Hattiesburg, Mississippi, was the quintessential New South city, built on the promise of quick cash and persistent oppression. In this brilliantly braided history, William Sturkey shows how African Americans made it into a place of opportunity, community, resilience, and rebellion. <i>Hattiesburg</i> is an insightful, powerful, and moving book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Kevin Boyle, author of <i>Arc of Justice: A Saga of Race, Civil Rights, and Murder in the Jazz Age</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Sturkey&#x2019;s beautifully written portrait of Hattiesburg, Mississippi&#x2015;from its founding after the Civil War through the emergence of the modern civil rights movement&#x2015;offers a fresh history of Jim Crow&#x2019;s development and decline, unlike any other I have read. Sturkey features people with agency, acting to shape their lives and improve their community, while showing how these individuals were acting within the context of broad economic trends related to war, depression, migration, and more. A wonderfully compelling book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Emilye Crosby, author of <i>A Little Taste of Freedom: The Black Freedom Struggle in Claiborne County, Mississippi</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In this masterful biography of an American place, Sturkey compels us to look anew at the world made by white supremacy and remade by the black freedom struggle. <i>Hattiesburg</i> is a timely reminder of how much remains to be said about our shared, segregated past, and few have said more in a single book than this author. This bold, imaginative book is essential reading for anyone seeking to fathom Jim Crow&#x2019;s rise, fall, and resilience&#x2015;in Mississippi and well beyond.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jason Morgan Ward, author of <i>Hanging Bridge: Racial Violence and America&#x2019;s Civil Rights Century</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Hattiesburg is not connected in the popular mind with civil rights history in the way of Selma and Montgomery, but Sturkey&#x2019;s vibrant history makes a strong case that, to understand how the civil rights movement emerged, it&#x2019;s essential to spend time there.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Sturkey provides a moving account of the evil of white supremacy.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Choice</i></b></p><h2>Radiant Landscapes: Transform Tiled Colors &amp; Textures into Dramatic Quilts</h2><p><table><tbody><tr><td>Light not only catches the eye, it can transform your work into something truly magical.

Tiles, in geometric shapes cut from fabric, are to the quilter what tesserae are to mosaicists. The tiles add background and movement, color and light. Loughman echoes elements of impressionist and pointillist art by manipulating light on quilts as Cezanne and Seurat did with small brush strokes on canvas. "Tiling large areas of your quilts," she writes, "allows you, in some ways, to follow in these master painters' footsteps." By playing with light and color, she designs additional dimensions to quilted landscapes, thereby creating smashing results. Her instruction book does not begin with the tiles, however: she starts with design; teaches color and value and hue; and considers fabric selection, including a chapter on customizing fabric through dyeing and painting. After explaining how to make, place, and stitch down the tiles, Loughman works through construction of four landscape projects.

While Eisenhower's troops defeated The Third Reich on the battlefields of Europe, the war against fascism was lost on the home front, to the same cadre of American elitists who built Hitler's war machine. At the center of this small confederacy two firms stand out: Brown Brothers &amp; Harriman, and Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. At the very eye of this oligarchy one family name stands above all others. Spanning over 90 years and 4 generations, the Bush family has chosen to ally themselves with Nazism and warmongering at home and abroad, ever willing to advance the Nazi agenda of global corporatism.</p><p>HISTORY WILL NEVER AGAIN BE THE SAME....Monumental, mammoth book - thoroughly exposes the almost unknown history of Nazi and fascist infiltration of America - details the subversion sinking the American ship into the waters of tyranny.

These essays argue, from a wide range of evidence, that the Gospels were intended for general circulation throughout all the early churches and, hence, were written for all Christians.<br><br>Loveday Alexander, Stephen C. Barton, Richard Bauckham, Richard Burridge, Michael B. Thompson, and Francis Watson examine such topics as the extent of communication between early Christian churches, book production and circulation in the Graeco-Roman world, the Gospel genre and its audience, the relationships between the Gospels, the faulty enterprise of reconstructing Gospel communities, and the hermeneutical and theological pitfalls of reading the Gospels as community texts. By putting in question a large body of assumptions that are almost universally accepted in contemporary scholarship, this book could fundamentally change both the method and the findings of Gospel interpretation.</p><p>Richard Bauckham is professor emeritus of New Testamentstudies at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, seniorscholar at Ridley Hall, Cambridge, and fellow of both theBritish Academy and the Royal Society of Edinburgh.<b>John Goldingay</b><br> "This is a wonderful book, a bombshell in the playground of New Testament study. In writing on interpretation I have felt vaguely uneasy about the notion that the unmentioned specific congregation is of key importance to understanding Gospel narrative, but I lacked the imaginative spark to query this universal 'given.' Now Richard Bauckham and his friends have called the bluff. 'Obvious' after 'obvious' point (for instance, Gospels are different from Epistles; why should anyone<i>write</i>&nbsp;a narrative for their own congregation?) draws forth a grin, a 'Yes,' and a punch into the air from the reader. They also tell us lots of fascinating things about the real world in which the Gospels were written and disseminated, and point out some of the presuppositions of the consensus they explode and the significance of the case they press. I look forward to watching the fallout. "<br><br><b>D. A. Carson</b><br> "Not many books on the canonical Gospels are truly groundbreaking, but this one is. Richard Bauckham and his colleagues convincingly challenge one of the most deeply rooted assumptions of contempoary scholarship, namely, that the Gospels were written out of and for fairly restrictive early communities that enjoyed relatively little contact with the whole church. This book persuasively argues that both in intent and in reality the Gospels were written for 'all Christians.' It deserves the widest possible circulation among pastors, students, and scholars alike, and it promises to revamp more than one shibboleth."<br><br><b>Peter Stuhlmacher</b><br> "The thesis that from the very beginning the four Gospels were intended not only for specific communities but also, and above all, for a general early Christian readership is substantiated by Bauckham and his coauthors in a historically clear and plausible fashion. This thesis is immediately obvious exegetically and hopefully will win quick acceptance. Bauckham's view helps overcome a whole range of problems left unsolved by the form- and redaction-critical investigation of the Gospels that has been dominant until now, and it gives us a new perception of the Gospels' significance as narrative proclamations of the life and messianic deeds of Jesus. "<br><br><b>I. Howard Marshall</b><br> "Unexamined assumptions are the bane of Gospel criticism. In this easily accessible, very readable symposium a group of leading scholars argues against the assumption that the Gospels were written for specific communities and reasserts that they were meant for reading by Christians everywhere. This thesis has important implications for the fashionable pursuit of reconstructing the readerships of the Gospels and then trying to explain the Gospels' contents in terms of their readers' needs; the way back to taking the Gospels seriously as biographies of Jesus is freed from yet another obstacle. This is a major work that could seriously alter the character of contemporary Gospel study for the better. "<br><br><b>The Bible Today</b><br> "A serious and helpful contribution to New Testament study that deserves to be engaged by other scholars."<br><br><b>Clergy Journal</b><br> "Bauckham and his colleagues write persuasively against the consensus of modern Gospel scholarship. Fascinating reading."<br><br><b>America</b><br> "[One] assumption of much modern Gospel study is the idea that each Gospel was written for a specific church or group of churches.

It&#x2019;s good snow, I thought as I slid forward and rested my chin on the vinyl of the front seat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sit back, honey,&#x201d; my mother, Mary, gently commanded. She was thirty-nine years old, but her tired eyes and the streaks of gray infiltrating her otherwise coal black hair made most people think she was much older. If your age was determined by what you&#x2019;d been through in life, they would have been right.<br> <br>&#x201c;But Mom, I can&#x2019;t see the snow when I sit back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. But just until we stop for gas.&#x201d;<br> <br>I scooted up farther and rested my worn Keds on the hump that ran through the middle of our old Pinto station wagon. I was skinny and tall for my age, which made my knees curl up toward my chest. Mom said I was safer in the backseat, but deep down I knew that it wasn&#x2019;t really about safety, it was about the radio. I was constantly playing with it, changing the dial from her boring Perry Como station to something that played real music.<br> <br>As we continued toward the gas station, I could see the edge of downtown Mount Vernon through the snow. A thousand points of red and green Christmas lights lined the edges of Main Street. Hot summer days in Washington State were rare, but when they happened, the light poles covered in Christmas lights seemed out of place. They hung there in a kind of backward hibernation until a city worker would plug them in and replace the bulbs that didn&#x2019;t wake up. But now, in December, the lights were working their magic, filling us kids with excitement for the season.<br> <br>That year I was more anxious than excited. I wanted it to be the year that Christmas finally returned to normal. For years, Christmas mornings in our home had been filled with gifts and laughter and smiling faces. But my father had died three years earlier&#x2014;and it seemed to me that Christmas had died with him.<br> <br>Before my father&#x2019;s death I didn&#x2019;t think much about our financial situation. We weren&#x2019;t wealthy, we weren&#x2019;t poor&#x2014;we just were. We&#x2019;d had a nice house in a good neighborhood, a hot dinner every night and, one summer, when I was five years old, we even went to Disneyland. I remember getting dressed up for the airplane ride. The only other vacation I remember happened a few years later when my parents took me to Birch Bay&#x2014;which sounds exotic but was really just a rocky beach about an hour away from our home.<br> <br>Back then we never wanted for anything, except maybe more time together.<br> <br>My father bought City Bakery when I was young&#x2014;it had been in town since the 1800s. He put in long hours at work, leaving almost every morning before the sun (or his son) rose. My mother would get me off to school, clean up around the house a little, start some laundry, and then join him at the bakery for the rest of the day.<br> <br>After school I would walk to the bakery to help my parents out. On some days the walk took less than half an hour, but it usually took me a lot longer. At least a few days each week I would stop at the edge of downtown in the middle of the bridge that crossed the I-5 freeway and watch the cars and trucks whiz by. A lot of kids would stand there and spit onto the roadway below, hoping to hit a car, but I wasn&#x2019;t that kind of kid. I just imagined myself spitting.<br> <br>I complained a lot about having to be at the bakery so much, especially when my dad made me wash the pots and pans, but secretly I loved to watch him work. Others might have called him a baker, but I thought of him as a master craftsman or a sculptor. Instead of a chisel he used dough, and instead of clay he used frosting&#x2014;but the result was always a masterpiece.<br> <br>Dad and my uncle Bob both apprenticed in their father&#x2019;s bakery from the time they were my age. Donning aprons, they washed a seemingly never-ending line of pots and pans, and they would learn recipes after school. In my dad&#x2019;s case, it wasn&#x2019;t long before the apprentice was more skilled than the master.<br> <br>Dad just had a knack for baking. He was the only one in the family who could bring his recipes to life. It wasn&#x2019;t long before City Bakery&#x2019;s breads and desserts were known as the best in town. Dad loved his creations almost as much as he loved his family.<br> <br>Saturdays were special because it was the day my father spent most of his time icing and decorating cakes. Not coincidentally, it was also the day I liked to work with him the most. Well, work might be a bit of an exaggeration, as I didn&#x2019;t do much baking myself. Taking bread out of the proof box after it had risen was about as far as he&#x2019;d let me go&#x2014;but I watched him closely, and I took advantage of my role as &#x201c;official frosting taster&#x201d; as often as possible.<br> <br>Although Dad continually tried to teach me his recipes, I never quite got them down. Mom blamed it on my having the attention span of a gnat, but I knew it was really because I liked eating better than I liked baking. I was never interested in being a baker; it was too much work and you had to get up way too early. But Dad never gave up hope that one day I might change my mind.<br> <br>His first mission was to teach me how to make cookies, but not long after putting me in charge of the cookie dough and mixer he realized he&#x2019;d made a mistake. A big mistake. If he&#x2019;d left me alone with that raw dough for just a few more minutes, he wouldn&#x2019;t have had enough left to bake. After that, Dad smartly switched his tactic from hands-on lessons to pop quizzes. He&#x2019;d show me how to make a few batches of German chocolate cake, then he&#x2019;d test me on the recipe and toss flour in my face when I invariably mentioned some ingredient that had no business being in a cake. Like meat.<br> <br>One day, right in the middle of an apple-strudel quiz, Dad&#x2019;s cashier (my mother) came into the back to ask if he&#x2019;d mind helping a customer. This wasn&#x2019;t entirely unusual&#x2014;Dad would come up front once in a while, mainly in the afternoons while the ovens were cooling and my mom made the daily trip to the bank. I think it was secretly one of his favorite times of the day; he was a real people person, and he loved to watch the faces of his customers as they sampled his latest creation.<br> <br>That day, I watched as Dad greeted Mrs. Olsen, a woman who seemed to me like the oldest person in town. She was a regular customer. When my mom waited on her, I noticed that she&#x2019;d always spend a little extra time just listening to Mrs. Olsen&#x2019;s stories. I guess she thought Mrs. Olsen was lonely. Dad treated her with the same kind of respect. He smiled warmly as he spoke to her, and I noticed the faintest hint of a smile begin to form on her face as well. Dad had that effect on a lot of people.<br> <br>Mrs. Olsen had come in for a single loaf of bread, but Dad spent five minutes trying to talk her into everything from his napoleons to his German chocolate cake. Ske kept refusing, but my dad insisted, saying it was all on him. She finally relented, and her smile stretched from ear to ear. She told him that he was too kind. I remember the word &#x201c;kind&#x201d; because I thought it was simple, and yet so true. My dad was kind.<br> <br>After her bread had been bagged and her free treats boxed, Mrs. Olsen reached into her purse and pulled out a kind of money I&#x2019;d never seen before. As far as I could tell it wasn&#x2019;t cash. It looked more like coupons&#x2014;except we didn&#x2019;t offer any coupons. As she turned to leave the store, my heart began to race. Had Dad just been scammed right in front of me? The bakery paid our bills (and, more importantly, it paid for my presents). I crept up next to my father at the cash register and, not thinking she could hear me, whispered, &#x201c;Dad, that&#x2019;s not money.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mrs. Olsen stopped dead in her tracks and looked at my father. He, in turn, glared at me. &#x201c;Eddie, into the back, please. Right now.&#x201d; His voice had a definite edge to it. He then gave Mrs. Olsen a sympathetic nod and another warm smile, and she turned and continued out the door. I knew I was in trouble.<br> <br>As I walked through the opening into the back, my face felt hotter than the oven I was now standing in front of. &#x201c;Eddie, I know you didn&#x2019;t mean it, but do you know how embarrassing that was for Mrs. Olsen?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I replied. I honestly didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>&#x201c;Eddie, Mrs. Olsen is a very good customer of ours. Her husband passed away about a year ago and she&#x2019;s had a hard time making ends meet. You&#x2019;re right, what she gave me isn&#x2019;t money, but it&#x2019;s just like it for people who need it. They&#x2019;re called food stamps, and our government is helping her buy groceries until she can get back on her feet. We don&#x2019;t talk about them in front of her because she doesn&#x2019;t like the fact that she has to ask others for help.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dad explained that while our family would never accept help from anyone, especially the government, there were good people who needed it. I immediately felt sorry for Mrs. Olsen&#x2014;sorry for anyone who needed to rely on others for that kind of help. And I was glad that we would never be in that position.<br> <br>A few months later I got a chance to prove to my father that I&#x2019;d learned my lesson.<br> <br>Mom had once again run to the bank, and I was in the front of the store putting fresh macaroons into the display case while Dad waited on customers. I watched as, once again, he accepted the funny-looking coupons as payment&#x2014;this time from a guy buying bread, a pie, and a dozen cookies. But now, instead of warm smiles, friendly conversation, and yummy dessert suggestions, my father was completely silent.<br> <br>After the customer left it was my turn to do the questioning. I followed him into the back. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong, Dad?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know that man, Eddie. He can work, but he chooses not to. Anyone who can earn money has no business taking it from others.&#x201d;<br> <br>I eventually came to understand that my father, who&#x2019;d grown up poor and struggled for everything we owned, had continually rejected offers of help from others. He had worked hard to build a business and provide for his family. He believed others should do the same. &#x201c;The government,&#x201d; he told me one night, &#x201c;is there to act as a safety net, not a candy machine.&#x201d;<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know if my mother had grown up with the same attitude or if she&#x2019;d just learned it from all those years with my dad&#x2014;but she felt the exact same way. With him now gone we were really struggling, but she refused to consider asking anyone for help. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get through this, Eddie,&#x201d; she told me more than once. &#x201c;Things are just a little tight right now, but there are so many others who need it more than we do.&#x201d;<br> <br>As usual, Mom was being an optimist. &#x201c;A little tight&#x201d; didn&#x2019;t begin to describe how frugal we had become. When we went out to dinner, which was only on very special occasions, she would always give me the same warning before the waitress appeared: &#x201c;Remember, Eddie, don&#x2019;t order any milk, we have plenty of it at home. No need to be wasteful.&#x201d;<br> <br>I knew better. It wasn&#x2019;t about waste, it was about money. That was all it was ever about. Mom worked seemingly endless hours at a seemingly endless number of jobs, our house was crumbling faster than Dad&#x2019;s famous apple turnovers, and I hadn&#x2019;t gotten a brag-worthy Christmas present since the Star Wars Millennium Falcon I&#x2019;d gotten two years earlier.<br> <br>But this year would be different. I had been on my best behavior for months now. I&#x2019;d taken out the garbage before Mom had asked, used my finely honed dishwashing skills at home, and had generally made sure that she wouldn&#x2019;t have any excuse to not get me the bike I deserved.<br> <br>Still, I wasn&#x2019;t leaving anything to chance. Every time a relative or neighbor asked what I wanted for Christmas, I made sure my mother was close enough to hear my finely tuned response: A red Huffy bike with a black banana seat.<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> <br>The Ford&#x2019;s loud motor snapped me out of yesterday&#x2019;s memories. We were on Main Street, and the once distant lights now glowed brightly through our foggy windows. I tried to look out the back windshield to see where we were, but I could only see my mop of dirty-blond hair reflecting back.<br> <br>Mom drove cautiously, although downtown seemed to be virtually deserted. A light turned red at the intersection ahead, and she slowly eased the car to a stop.<br> <br>&#x201c;Eddie, look!&#x201d; She was pointing out the passenger-side window.<br> <br>I rubbed my hand back and forth on the glass to clear the condensation. We had come to a stop right outside Richmond&#x2019;s Sporting Goods&#x2019; big storefront window, the very place I had first seen the Huffy I&#x2019;d been dreaming about all year.<br> <br>My eyes expertly searched the window, darting from baseball bats to gloves to sleds to...there it was. The Huffy. My Huffy. Its bright red frame, shiny chrome handlebars, and black banana seat sparkled brilliantly through the snow and fog.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow.&#x201d; It was the only word I could come up with.<br> <br>Mom wasn&#x2019;t looking at the bike anymore, she was looking at me in the rearview mirror. I couldn&#x2019;t see her mouth, but I knew that she was smiling. I smiled back. Perry Como provided the sound track.<br> <br>&#x201c;You want to pump the gas?&#x201d; she asked a few minutes later as she pulled up to the self-service island. We stopped for gas a lot because our Pinto was always thirsty and Mom usually only had enough money to fill the tank partway.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said, leaping over the seat and following her out the door. &#x201c;Can I get some Red Vines when I go in to pay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Eddie,&#x201d; my mother said gently. &#x201c;I have the money for Red Vines but not enough for the dentist.&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;Now, scoot.&#x201d; I knew she didn&#x2019;t have money for the dentist, but her excuse didn&#x2019;t fool me. I knew she didn&#x2019;t have money for Red Vines either.<br> <br>I gave her the best look of disappointment I could muster. Still, deep down, I had hope. No money for Red Vines could mean that she was saving it all for something else.<br> <br>My bike.<br></p><h2>Second Corinthians (Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture)</h2><p>There is an increasing hunger among Catholics to study the Bible in depth and in a way that integrates Scripture with Catholic doctrine, worship, and daily life. <i>Second Corinthians</i> is the fourth of seventeen volumes in the Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture (CCSS), a new series that will cover the entire New Testament and interprets Scripture from within the living tradition of the Church.

Dabney (1820-1898)&#x2014;preacher, theologian, soldier, poet, and essayist&#x2014;strongly condemned the public education of his day. He saw with prophetic insight that State education could not help but be secularized since it was designed to please the people. As a result, he argued, public education would begin to teach its students not truth, but the values and virtues which were palatable to society at large.<br> <br> Although a century has passed since Dabney first wrote this essay, the questions that parents face haven't changed. Secular education still seeks to indoctrinate our children under the pretence of objectivity, and truth is still sacrificed for the sake of social "unity."<br> <br> We must acknowledge with Dabney that proper education is about heart and soul, not just propositions and facts. Only then will our children learn truth and be equipped to live out our faith.</p><p></p><h2>Introduction To Health Research Methods: A Practical Guide</h2><p>From best-selling author of Introduction to Global Health, Introduction to Health Research Methods demystifies the research process and empowers students (and other new investigators) to conduct their own original research projects. <br>Using clear language and practical examples, the text has five sections that describe the entire research process beginning with the identification of a research question and the selection of a study approach, proceeding through the collection and analysis of data and the preparation of a formal scientific report, and ending with academic and professional presentations and publishing.<br>By breaking the research process down into manageable steps, Introduction to Health Research Methods communicates the excitement and importance of health research&#x2015;and encourages readers to make their own contribution to improving the health of individuals and communities through research.<br>Key features:<br><br>� A step-by-step guide to conducting research in medicine, public health, and other health sciences<br>� For classroom use or for guiding independent work on scholarly projects<br>� Covers the entire research process from identifying a study question and selecting a study approach to collecting and analyzing data to disseminating the findings<br>� Includes detailed information about how to conduct primary studies (collection of new data), secondary analyses (analysis of existing data), and tertiary studies (literature reviews)<br>� Weaves elements of research ethics throughout the book</p><p>Professor of Epidemiology and Global Health, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia</p><h2>Fundamentals of Engineering Design (2nd Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This book provides extensive coverage of fundamental engineering design topics, embedded in a real-world context, while avoiding discipline-specific specialty topics. <b> </b> <i>Fundamentals of Engineering Design</i> includes extensive coverage of the steps taken when formulating design problems, global optimization, and the role of the Internet in Mechanical Engineering. <b> </b>A useful reference for professionals in Mechanical Engineering. </p></p><p><p> Engineering design concepts are as fundamental to undergraduate engineering education as the traditional sciences.

Wells, George Orwell, Philip K. Dick and Harlan Ellison amongst others. Overshadowed by the titanic success of <i>Frankenstein</i>, Mary Shelley&#x2019;s neglected masterpiece tells of a future laid waste by plague. Lionel Varney, an indolent nobleman, is immune to the savage effects of the disease having been bitten by an early victim. Varney is forced to watch the long decline of civilisation as humanity sinks slowly into extinction. <br> <br> FLAME TREE 451: From mystery to crime, supernatural to horror and fantasy to science fiction, Flame Tree 451 offers a healthy diet of werewolves and mechanical men, blood-lusty vampires, dastardly villains, mad scientists, secret worlds, lost civilizations and escapist fantasies. Discover a storehouse of tales gathered specifically for the reader of the fantastic. Each book features a brand new biography and glossary of Literary, Gothic and Victorian terms.</p><p><p> Mary Shelley&#x2019;s third published novel, <em>The Last Man</em>, is a disillusioned vision of the end of civilization, set in the twenty-first century. The book offers a sweeping account of war, plague, love, and desolation. It is the sort of apocalyptic vision that was widespread at the time, though Shelley&#x2019;s treatment of the theme goes beyond the conventional; it is extraordinarily interesting and deeply moving. </p> <p> If <em>The Last Man</em> is in some sense a &#x201c;conventional&#x201d; text of the period, it is also intensely personal in its origin; Shelley refers in her journal to the last man as her alter ego, &#x201c;the last relic of a beloved race, my companions extinct before me.&#x201d; The novel thus develops out of and contributes to a network of story and idea in which fantasy, allusion, convention, and autobiography are densely interwoven. </p> <p> This new version of the first edition (1826) sets out to provide not only a thoroughly annotated text, but also contextual materials to help the reader acquire knowledge of the intellectual and literary milieu out of which the novel emerged. Appendices include material on &#x201c;the last man&#x201d; as early nineteenth-century hero, texts from the debate initiated by Malthus in 1798 about the adequacy of food supply to sustain human population, various accounts of outbreaks of plague, and Shelley&#x2019;s poems representing her feelings after the death of her husband.</p><b>Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley</b> (1797&#x2013;1851) was born in London, to her father the writer William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, an influential social campaigner who died 11 days after the birth of her daughter.

Amongst their friends were Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Lord Byron, the latter of whom offered the challenge to Mary to write a ghost story which later became <i>Frankenstein</i>.</p><h2>Statistical Methods</h2><p>Offers a comprehensive update of this classic statistics textbook, with careful adherence to the intent, approach, and style of the original authors.</p><p><p><b>George W Snedecor</b> was an American mathematician and statistician.

Citizens and politicians have trouble controlling the runaway bureaucratic machine. Managers have trouble managing it. Employees dislike working in it. Clients can&#39;t get the goods from it. Teachers have difficulty getting a grip on it. Optimists argue that soon all of this will be fixed. The new Fifth Edition of Ralph P. Hummel&#39;s classic text maintains just the opposite - that despite all the current rhetoric from proponents of total quality management, corporate reengineering, and the new public management, it&#39;s still &#34;business as usual&#34; for bureaucracies. The persistent reality of organizational structure remains resilient in the face of feel-good trends and values. For this edition the book has been thoroughly revised and updated, with two key changes: each of the six core chapters has been trimmed and edited to consolidate and streamline the important organizational theory developments since the book&#39;s initial publication; and, each chapter contains newly added critiques of the postmodern theory of modern organizations, pursuing the theme that postmodernism covers up the persistent reality of organizational structure.</p><p>&#34;By moving from a critique of Modernity to an insistence on Postmodernism&#39;s aspirations for humanity, Hummel takes the debate over bureaucracy to a new level. Fellow polemicists on the subject will welcome his hotter fire in the belly and more caustic challenge to traditional public administration thinking.&#34; - Charles Goodsell, Virginia Tech&#34;</p><h2>Collected Poems (MacMillan Collector&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p>As well as being one of the major literary figures of the twentieth century and the recipient of the 1923 Nobel Prize for Literature, William Butler Yeats (1865-1939) is the greatest lyric poet that Ireland has produced.</p><p>Part of the Macmillan Collector&#x2019;s Library; a series of stunning, clothbound, pocket sized classics with gold foiled edges and ribbon markers. These beautiful books make perfect gifts or a treat for any book lover. This edition features an illuminating introduction by author and academic Dr Robert Mighall.</p><p>Yeats&#x2019; early work includes the beguiling 'When You are Old', 'The Cloths of Heaven' and 'The Lake Isle of Innisfree' but, unusually for a poet, Yeats's later works, including 'Parnell's Funeral', surpass even those of his youth. All are present in this volume, which reproduces the 1933 edition of W. B. Yeats's <i>Collected Poems</i>.</p></p><p>William Butler Yeats, whom many consider this century's greatest poet, began as a bard of the Celtic Twilight, reviving legends and Rosicrucian symbols. By the early 1900s, however, he was moving away from plush romanticism, his verse morphing from the incantatory rhythms of "I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree" into lyrics "as cold and passionate as the dawn." At every stage, however, Yeats plays a multiplicity of poetic roles. There is the romantic lover of "When You Are Old" and "A Poet to His Beloved" ("I bring you with reverent Hands / The books of my numberless dreams..."). And there are the far more bitter celebrations of Maud Gonne, who never accepted his love and engaged in too much politicking for his taste: "Why should I blame her that she filled my days / With misery, or that she would of late / Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways, / Or hurled the little streets upon the great, / Had they but courage equal to desire?" There is also the poet of conscience--and confrontation. His 1931 "Remorse for Intemperate Speech" ends: "Out of Ireland have we come. / Great hatred, little room, / Maimed us at the start. / I carried from my mother's womb / A fanatic heart." <p> Yeats was to explore several more sides of himself, and of Ireland, before his <i>Last Poems</i> of 1938-39. Many are difficult, some snobbish, others occult and spiritualist. As Brendan Kennelly writes, Yeats "produces both poppycock and sublimity in verse, sometimes closely together." On the other hand, many prophetic masterworks are poppycock-free--for example, "The Second Coming" ("Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer; / Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world...") and such inquiries into inspiration as "Among School Children" ("O body swayed to music, O brightening glance, How can we know the dancer from the dance?"). And at his best, Yeats extends the meaning of love poetry beyond the obviously romantic: love becomes a revolutionary emotion, attaching the poet to friends, history, and the passionate life of the mind. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>As well as being one of the major literary figures of the twentieth century, William Butler Yeats (1865-1939) is the greatest lyric poet that Ireland has ever produced. He was the acknowledged leader of the Irish Literary Renaissance, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1923.His earl lyrical poetry includes &#39;When You Are Old&#39;, &#39;The Cloths of Heaven&#39; and &#39;The Lake Isle of Innisfree&#39; but, unusually for a poet, Yeats&#39;s later work surpasses the poems of his youth. T. S. Eliot described him as &#39;one of those few whose history is the history of their own time, who are part of the consciousness of an age which cannot be understood without them&#39;.</p><h2>Stereo Views: An Illustrated History and Price Guide</h2><p><b>Stereo view collectors will be delighted to see this book on the shelves!</b><p><br>The second edition of the most authoritative book on Stereo Views - the only one to offer a detailed price guide - features nearly all new photographs, updated and expanded price listings, as well as new sections on foreign views, Internet dealings, and more!</p><p><br>This book includes an expanded, detailed history of stereo views, photographers and publishers as well as information on collecting, evaluating, and organizing a collection.

Developers, politicians, and citizens alike blame "poor planning" for a host of community ills. But what are plans really supposed to do? How do they work? What problems can they successfully address, and what is beyond their scope? In <i>Urban Development</i>, leading planning scholar Lewis Hopkins tackles these thorny issues as he explains the logic of plans for urban development and justifies prescriptions about when and how to make them. He explores the concepts behind plans, some that are widely accepted but seldom examined, and others that modify conventional wisdom about the use and usefulness of plans. The book: places the role of plans and planners within the complex system of urban development offers examples from the history of plans and planning discusses when plans should be made (and when they should not be made) gives a realistic idea of what can be expected from plans examines ways of gauging the success or failure of plansThe author supports his explanations with graphics, case examples, and hypothetical illustrations that enliven, clarify, and make concrete the discussions of how decisions about plans are and should be made.<i>Urban Development</i> will give all those involved with planning human settlements a more thorough understanding of why and how plans are made, enabling them to make better choices about using and making plans. It is an important contribution that will be essential for students and faculty in planning theory, land use planning, and planning project courses.</p><p></p><h2>The Raven King: Matthias Corvinus and the Fate of His Lost Library</h2><p><p>Seizing the Hungarian throne at the age of fifteen, Matthias Corvinus, the "Raven King,&#x201d; was an effervescent presence on the fifteenth-century stage.

Money maturity does include skills, such as understanding investment options and using a budget effectively, but it goes much deeper, to the feelings, the heart, and, yes, the soul.</blockquote> By following three composite characters throughout the book and examining their experiences through the prisms of his own background and development, Kinder explains how to evolve naturally through these seven specific states (innocence, pain, knowledge, understanding, vigor, vision, and aloha) to achieve both financial and personal security. <i>--Howard Rothman</i>DISCOVER A POWERFUL NEW WAY TO LOOK AT YOUR MONEY AND YOUR LIFE<p>Where do our attitudes about money come from -- and how do they influence our lives? How can we approach financial issues with honesty and without fear? In this groundbreaking book, renowned Buddhist teacher George Kinder, a Harvard-trained certified financial planner, demonstrates how we can literally transform our lives emotionally and financially by achieving "money maturity" -- a full understanding of the spiritual and psychological issues surrounding our money lives. Drawing on ancient Buddhist wisdom and his years of financial practice, Kinder has created a revolutionary journey -- one designed to help us uncover the roots of our attitudes about money, and attain true peace, freedom, and security in our financial lives.

What characterizes it? This brilliant and beautifully written book dissolves the logic of a beginning based on writing, civilization, or historical consciousness and offers a model for a history that escapes the continuing grip of the Judeo-Christian time frame. Daniel Lord Smail argues that in the wake of the Decade of the Brain and the best-selling historical work of scientists like Jared Diamond, the time has come for fundamentally new ways of thinking about our past. He shows how recent work in evolution and paleohistory makes it possible to join the deep past with the recent past and abandon, once and for all, the idea of prehistory. Making an enormous literature accessible to the general reader, he lays out a bold new case for bringing neuroscience and neurobiology into the realm of history.</p><p>"This is surely a new paradigm for the study of history that will be regarded as revolutionary but which is also well justified. To my knowledge, no other book integrates the study of human history with principles of biological and cultural evolution on such an ambitious scale."&#x2014;David Sloan Wilson, author of <i>Darwin's Cathedral: Evolution, Religion and the Nature of Society</i><br><br>"This is one of the most exciting books I've read in years. It is so accessible, so groundbreaking, so stimulating, so important that I imagine the next generation of historians will be deeply influenced by what Smail has to say here. Simply dazzling."&#x2014;Lynn Hunt, author of <i>Inventing Human Rights</i><b>Daniel Lord Smail</b> is Professor of History at Harvard University.

Retaining the unique approach of the previous editions, this text interweaves material on probability and measure, so that probability problems generate an interest in measure theory and measure theory is then developed and applied to probability. Probability and Measure provides thorough coverage of probability, measure, integration, random variables and expected values, convergence of distributions, derivatives and conditional probability, and stochastic processes. The Third Edition features an improved treatment of Brownian motion and the replacement of queuing theory with ergodic theory.<br> <br> Like the previous editions, this new edition will be well received by students of mathematics, statistics, economics, and a wide variety of disciplines that require a solid understanding of probability theory.</p><p>PATRICK BILLINGSLEY is Professor of Statistics and Mathematics at the University of Chicago.

Other painters and sculptors gathered around these two geniuses in Rome in the first decades of the 17th century. Together they formulated a new artistic language which later came to be known as Roman Baroque. In a very short period of time, Rome became an international cultural hotspot, the breeding ground of new ideas and initiatives. Artists from all over Europe came to the Eternal City to study the many remnants of Roman Antiquity and to seek the increasing patronage of the popes, cardinals, and the local nobility. More than ever before, painters and sculptors shared ambitions, personal friendships, and worked together, often on large papal projects. Caravaggio, Bernini, and their fellow artists embody this artistic fraternization. Together, their works tell the story of the birth of this new movement in art, and the radical artistic innovation which would prove to have far-reaching influence in Europe.</p><p>FRITS SCHOLTEN is Head of the Department of Sculpture at the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. <br><br>GUDRUN SWOBODA is Curator at Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna.</p><h2>Europe&#39;s Promise: Why the European Way Is the Best Hope in an Insecure Age</h2><p>A quiet revolution has been occurring in post-World War II Europe. A world power has emerged across the Atlantic that is recrafting the rules for how a modern society should provide economic security, environmental sustainability, and global stability. In <i>Europe's Promise</i>, Steven Hill explains Europe's bold new vision. For a decade Hill traveled widely to understand this uniquely European way of life. He shatters myths and shows how Europe's leadership manifests in five major areas: economic strength, with Europe now the world's wealthiest trading bloc, nearly as large as the U.S. and China <i>combined</i>; the best health care and other workfare supports for families and individuals; widespread use of renewable energy technologies and conservation; the world's most advanced democracies; and regional networks of trade, foreign aid, and investment that link one-third of the world to the European Union. <i>Europe's Promise</i> masterfully conveys how Europe has taken the lead in this make-or-break century challenged by a worldwide economic crisis and global warming.</p><p>"Steven Hill ends the transatlantic debate over which economic and political system is superior: Europe wins. While America and China fight for oil and minerals, Europe already achieves more with less. Indeed, the path to the American Dream is the European Way."&#x2015;Parag Khanna, author of <i>The Second World: Empires and Influence in the New Global Order</i><br><br>"Like a reverse Alexis de Tocqueville, Steven Hill dauntlessly explores a society largely unknown to his compatriots back home. Sweeping away the ideological posturing, he shows us exactly how the modern European Way works and the promise it holds for an America which has slipped to become, in terms of social, economic and energy policy, the Old World."&#x2015;Hendrik Hertzberg, senior editor, <i>The New Yorker</i>, author of <i>Obamanos!: The Birth of a New Political Era</i><br><br>"<i>Europe's Promise</i> should startle, inform, and galvanize Americans in raising the ante in favor of a political economy where people matter first."&#x2015;Ralph Nader<br><br>&#x201c;As Steven Hill compellingly argues in his excellent <i>Europe's Promise: Why the European Way Is the Best Hope in an Insecure Age</i>, Europe has become a dynamic, transformational force in the world and stands as a clear model of success on so many fronts that we must push reset in our assessment of Europe's course. Americans today should learn a bit about how Europe has quietly and incrementally added to its size and global weight and maintained an innovative approach to broad public challenges like renewable energy, capital punishment, social welfare, and even corporate dynamism.&#x201d;&#x2015;Steve Clemons, director of the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation, author of the political blog, <i>The Washington Note</i><br><br>"<i>Europe's Promise</i> is a provocative and illuminating book that should lead Americans to think hard about our own assumptions and priorities. By closely examining Europe's economic and political practices, Hill reveals a new Europe that has become the world's leader during this century challenged by global economic crisis, climate crisis, and new geopolitical tensions. In these times of hope and fear, read this captivating book to discover new and creative models for building a better future.&#x201d;&#x2015;Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor and publisher of <i>The Nation</i><br><br>&#x201c;Hill's book is an elegant and counterintuitive manifesto for a new politics of interdependence that could take the world through the turmoil of the economic and global warming crises.&#x201d;&#x2015;Mark Leonard, Executive Director, European Council on Foreign Relations<br><br>"What can the United States learn from Europe? If you believe what's said in Washington, the answer is 'not much'. If you read Steven Hill's intelligent, broad-ranging, and deeply researched book, you'll find the correct answer is 'a great deal'&#x2015;and now is the time to learn it."&#x2015;Jacob S.

Whether for translational or clinical application, it presents the concepts of Chinese medicine exactly as they would come to the mind of a Chinese physician speaking or writing in their native language. <p>Arranged as a classical dictionary, definitions are provided in English alphabetic order, and include the english term, the source Chinese term, its Pinyin transliteration (including spoken tone), pronunciation, etymology, and one or more definitions as applied in Chinese medicine. Terms used within definitions are cross-referenced and disease and symptom descriptions include the standard therapies applied in the People's Republic of China. Each definition is referenced to one or more Chinese source. In all, it lists the characters, Pinyin, translations, and definitions for more than 10,000 medical concepts, including treatments for the patterns catalogued, 2,000 formulas, 1,700 natural drugs, and 1,500 acupoints. </p><p>The definitions and treatments are drawn from clinically authoritative Chinese medical sources, all of which are cited. The many useful features include a full set of English common and commercial names for medicinal substances, as well as standard Latin scientific names. Western medical correspondences are noted, as is nomenclature put forward by the World Health Organization. The index is comprehensive and fully cross referenced; it also includes lesser-used terms and nomenclature so it may be used as a translators' glossary. There is one foreword by Chen Keji, the pioneer of integrated Chinese medicine, and another by Paul Unschuld, the renowned sinologist. </p><p>This is a valuable work that will provide rapid access to an enormous amount of information for the student, researcher, or clinician, and is sure to become the new reference source for academic studies, international exchange, and training in Chinese medicine.</p></p><p>Whether using the Practical Dictionary as a source of terminology, as an editorial support, or to learn how the Chinese define their terms, understanding the indexing philosophy is worthwhile. The index is huge, nearly 200 pages. It includes every term, book, medicinal, formula, acupoint and western medical correspondence found in the text. The authors designed it as a translators' glossary to save translators and scholars the need to buy a stand-alone gloss. Because the definitions section is organized like a standard dictionary, there is no need to use the index for English terms. Thus, the index is organized for those who begin their search in Chinese. For example, if you look for ``dispersion'' in the index, you won't find it. But, you will find <b>xiao</b> in the first tone, the three characters and terms associated with it, as well as <b>xiao</b> in the first tone followed by <b>fa</b> in the third tone, all of which are linked to ``disperse,'' or ``dispersion.'' <p>So, for English, search directly in the text. For Chinese, you can begin in the index. However, because the Pinyin entries are listed in alphabetical order by tone (1, 2, etc.) in both the index and definitions sections, you can begin in either depending upon your need for defintion. </p><p>If you know neither the Chinese nor the English for a term, you can still find it reasonably fast. Just find the definition for a related body-part, pattern or symptom. Once there, check for words in small capitals. These are further entries. Also look for the labels ``Compare, Synonym,'' and ``See.'' These are cross references to related definitions. The abbreviations ACU, MED, TRT and WMC which appear in small boxes point to treatment-related references such as acupoints, medicinals, formulas and western medical correspondences. For example, if you want a defintion or treatment but know neither the Chinese nor the English for a term related to urination, look under ``urine." There you will find references to associated symptoms, patterns, and treatments. </p><p>For every search, the shortest route depends upon what you know and what you need to know. </p><p>If you know the functional class of a medicinal, and need only the nomenclature, look in Appendix II. </p><p> If you know the functional class of a formula, and need only the nomenclature, look in Appendix III. </p><p> If you know the latin, Chinese or English for a medicinal, and need only the nomenclature, use the index. </p><p> If you know the Chinese or English for a formula, and need only the nomenclature, use the index. </p><p> If you know the Chinese or English for an acupoint, and need only the nomenclature, use the index. </p><p> If you know the channel for an acupoint, and need only the nomenclature, look in Appendix IV by aphanumeric designation. </p><p> If you know the English for term, look in the text itself in aphabetical order, regardless of whether you need the nomenclature or the defintion. </p><p> If you know only the Chinese for a term, look in the index first.</p>Text: English, Chinese</p><h2>Turning Stones: My Days and Nights with Children at Risk A Caseworker&#39;s Story</h2><p>Why does an infant die of malnutrition?

He has selected eight cases illustrating the extreme pressures of the work and indicating why it is that the system so often fails in its mission. He recounts unsparingly how three years into his job he made a fatal mistake, failing to recognize the plight of a little boy who later died of starvation.

It is home to more than seventy million people and has for centuries been one of the world&#x2019;s richest agricultural zones. Today however it is undergoing profound changes. China&#x2019;s development policies aim to interconnect the region through high-speed transportation networks and to transform its people into modern urbanized consumers. By 2025 a series of dams will have harnessed the river&#x2019;s energy, bringing an end to its natural cycles and cutting off food supplies for over half of the basin&#x2019;s population. Yet&nbsp;there has been little reporting on this monumental change.<br><br> In <i>The Last Days of the Mekong</i>, Brian Eyler takes us on a revealing tour of the Mekong and those who depend on its resources. He travels from the river&#x2019;s headwaters in China to its delta in Southern Vietnam. Along the way he meets the region&#x2019;s diverse peoples, from villagers to community leaders to politicians and policymakers. Through conversations with them, he reveals how China&#x2019;s expansionist policies are drastically&#x2014;and often literally&#x2014;reshaping environments. He also highlights the work being done by locals and international groups to save the Mekong and its fragile ecosystem. Eyler makes the case that there are environmentally-sound solutions, but argues these can only come about from serious cooperation and an increased pressure from the international community.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Brian Eyler</b> is director of the IES Abroad Kunming Center at Yunnan University.

It is Woolf&#39;s first complete rendering of her &#34;stream of consciousness&#34; mode, which displays the inner workings of the mind as it considers the surface and darker depths of reality.</p><p>As Clarissa Dalloway walks through London on a fine June morning, a sky-writing plane captures her attention. Crowds stare upwards to decipher the message while the plane turns and loops, leaving off one letter, picking up another. Like the airplane's swooping path, Virginia Woolf's <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> follows Clarissa and those whose lives brush hers--from Peter Walsh, whom she spurned years ago, to her daughter Elizabeth, the girl's angry teacher, Doris Kilman, and war-shocked Septimus Warren Smith, who is sinking into madness.<p> As Mrs. Dalloway prepares for the party she is giving that evening, a series of events intrudes on her composure. Her husband is invited, without her, to lunch with Lady Bruton (who, Clarissa notes anxiously, gives the most amusing luncheons). Meanwhile, Peter Walsh appears, recently from India, to criticize and confide in her. His sudden arrival evokes memories of a distant past, the choices she made then, and her wistful friendship with Sally Seton.</p><p> Woolf then explores the relationships between women and men, and between women, as Clarissa muses, "It was something central which permeated; something warm which broke up surfaces and rippled the cold contact of man and woman, or of women together.... Her relation in the old days with Sally Seton. Had not that, after all, been love?" While Clarissa is transported to past afternoons with Sally, and as she sits mending her green dress, Warren Smith catapults desperately into his delusions. Although his troubles form a tangent to Clarissa's web, they undeniably touch it, and the strands connecting all these characters draw tighter as evening deepens. As she immerses us in each inner life, Virginia Woolf offers exquisite, painful images of the past bleeding into the present, of desire overwhelmed by society's demands. <i>--Joannie Kervran Stangeland</i></p>This edition of Mrs. Dalloway includes substantial explanatory notes compiling past scholarship while identifying new allusions, and a list of textual variants among all editions in Woolf&#39;s lifetime. It also features a composition history, documenting how Woolf&#39;s reading, friendships, and culture contributed to the book, and Woolf&#39;s seldom-reprinted 1928 introduction.</p><h2>Principles of Information Security</h2><p>Specifically oriented to the needs of information systems students, PRINCIPLES OF INFORMATION SECURITY, 5e delivers the latest technology and developments from the field.

The guns were managed and operated by over 14,000 men. In three days over 50,000 rounds were fired. What impact did artillery have on this famous battle? How efficiently were the guns used? What were the strengths and weaknesses on each side? &#34;Civil War Artillery At Gettysburg&#34; answers these questions and many more. Using accessible descriptions, this work details the state of the art of this &#34;long arm&#34; as it existed at the time of the battle. It is an informative overview of field artillery in general while using the battle of Gettysburg to illustrate artillery technology. For it was Gettysburg when the artillery branch of both armies had matured to the point where its organization would stay relatively unchanged for the remainder of the war. Both armies prior to Gettysburg had neither the same mix of guns nor, more importantly, the same structure of organization as it did at this battle. The effects were telling. &#34;This book is an artillery &#39;buff&#39;s&#39; delight...The work meticulously examines the forming of the respective artillery arms of the two armies; the organization; artillery technology; guns; equipment and animals constituting that arm; ammunition; artillery operations; the artillerymen and, finally, actions of the guns on July 2 and 3....The work is perfect for someone seeking more data than found in most general histories of the battle...Nicely illustrated to supplement the text, the succinctly written technical details of ballistics, projectile composition and impact of technology for battlefield lethality will prove similarly useful and exciting for anyone captivated by the guns of Gettysburg.&#34; Book review by B. F. Cooling, The Civil War Courier &#34;Rather than being a dull treatise, &#39;Artillery at Gettysburg&#39;...proves to be an engaging book... Cole explains the benefits and liabilities of each piece of artiillery....His use of photographs, diagrams, and maps are excellent and integrate seamlessly into the text....Not only does it explain why events unfolded the way they did , it helps explain how they unfolded.&#34; Book review by Maj. James Gates, USAF, Military Review &#34;No other modern book on Civil War artillery of this size is as detailed...as this book is generally...The author&#39;s broad approach to the whole subject of artillery tactics shine when he compares and contrasts several artillery incidents at Gettysburg that better explain what was going on at the time....This book is essential for all those interested in Civil War artillery, 19th century artillery, or just the battle of Gettysburg. Highly recommended.&#34; Book review by Peter A. Frandsen, The Artilleryman &#34;I found Civil War Artillery at Gettysburg to be an informative and well written account of the &#39;long-arm&#39; at Gettysburg.

At a ceremonial dance, the young, earnest silversmith Laughing Boy falls in love with Slim Girl, a beautiful but elusive &#34;American&#34;-educated Navajo. As they experience all of the joys and uncertainties of first love, the couple must face a changing way of life and its tragic consequences.</p><p>OLIVER LA FARGE (1901&#x2013;1963) first traveled to Navajo territory on a Harvard archaeological dig. Laughing Boy was his first novel.I<br><br> He was riding the hundred miles from T&#x2019;o Tlakai to Ts� Lani to attend a dance, or rather, for the horse-racing that would come afterwards. The sun was hot and his belly was empty, but life moved in rhythm with his pony loping steadily as an engine down the miles. He was lax in the saddle, leaning back, arm swinging the rope&#x2019;s end in time to the horse&#x2019;s lope. His new red headband was a bright colour among the embers of the sun-struck desert, undulating like a moving graph of the pony&#x2019;s lope, or the music of his song <br><br> Nashdui bik&#x2019;� dinni, eya-a, eyo-o . . . Wildcat&#x2019;s feet hurt, eya-a, eyo-o . . .&#x2019;<br><br> Rope&#x2019;s end, shoulders, song, all moved together, and life flowed in one stream. He threw his head back to sing louder, and listened to the echo from the cliffs on his right. He was thinking about a bracelet he should make, with four smooth bars running together, and a turquoise in the middle if he could get the silver. He wished he could work while riding; everything was so perfect then, like the prayers, hozoji nashad, travelling in beauty. His hands, his feet, his head, his insides all were hozoji, all were very much alive. He whooped and struck up the Magpie Song till the empty desert resounded <br><br> A-a-a-in�, a-a-a-in�, Ya-a-in�-ain�, ko-ya-ain� . . .&#x2019;<br><br> He was lean, slender, tall, and handsome, Laughing Boy, with a new cheap headband and a borrowed silver belt to make ragged clothes look fine. At noon, having no money, he begged coffee from a trader at Chinlee and went on, treasuring his hunger because of the feasting to come. Now he began to meet Navajos of all ages, riding to the dance. The young men bunched together a line of jingling bridles, dark, excited faces, flashing silver, turquoise, velveteen shirts, dirty, ragged overalls, a pair of plaid calico leggins, a pair of turkey-red ones. Some of them were heavy with jewelry; Horse Giver&#x2019;s Son wore over four hundred dollars in silver alone; most of them had more than Laughing Boy. They stopped to look at his bow-guard, which he himself had made. I am a good jeweller,&#x2019; he said, elated; I make silver run like a song.&#x2019; You should make a song about yourself,&#x2019; they told him, and teach the burros to sing it.&#x2019; Have you had any rain up by T&#x2019;o Tlakai?&#x2019; No, it is just like last year. It is the devil. The grass is all dried up and the sheep are dying.&#x2019; They had a cloudburst over by T&#x2019;isya Lani. It washed out the dam.&#x2019; It washed out the missionary&#x2019;s house, they say. His wife ran out in something thin and got wet, they say.&#x2019; Ei-yei!&#x2019; Tall Hunter and his wife drove past in a brand-new buckboard behind two fast-trotting, grey mules. He owned over five hundred head of horses, and his wife had thick strings of turquoise and coral around her neck. His brother is in jail for stealing cattle, they say.&#x2019; What is jail?&#x2019; asked Laughing Boy. Slender Hair explained: It is something the American Chief does to you. He puts you in a room of stone, like a Moqui house, only it is dark and you can&#x2019;t get out. People die there, they say. They haven&#x2019;t any room; they can&#x2019;t see anything, they say. I do not like to talk about it.&#x2019; Laughing Boy thought, I should rather die. He wanted to ask more, but was ashamed to show his ignorance before these southern Navajos, many of whom wore hats like Americans, and who knew so much of Americans&#x2019; ways. They raced. His horse was tired, but it won by a nose, which was just as well, since he had bet his bow-guard. Now he had six dollars. He hoped there would be gambling. Ts� Lani showed a distant bonfire in the dusk, with mounted Indians moving in on it like spokes of a wheel. About two hundred young men came together half a mile away, making their ponies prance, exchanging greetings. Crooked Ear carried the ceremonial wand. Now they all lined up, with the dull, red sunset behind their black figures. They started going like getting off to a race, right into a gallop, yelling. Over by the fire was shouting, and another line tearing towards them. The world was full of a roar of hooves and two walls of noise rushing together, the men leaning forward over their horses&#x2019; necks, mouths wide. E-e-e-e-e!&#x2019; They met in a great swirl of plunging, dodging horses, and swept on all together, whooping for dear life, with the staff in front of them, almost onto the fire, then dissolved with jingling of bits, laughter, and casual jokes as they unsaddled by the pool. The steady motion of excitement was slowed then, in the last of the day, by the rocks and the pinons, by the reflection of the sky in the pool where flat, vague silhouettes of horses stooped to drink. The voices of many people, the twinkling of fires continuued the motif, joining the time of quiet with elation past and to come; a little feeling of expectation in Laughing Boy&#x2019;s chest, a joyful emptiness, part hungeeeeer and part excitement. He tended his pony minutely. The little mare had had two days of loping; shortly he wanted to race her; three days of rest would not be too much. She was his only horse; he had traded two others for her. She was tough, as a horse had to be to live at all in the North country. He ran his hands down her withers, feeling the lean, decisive muscles. In all that section, from Dennihuitso to Biltabito, from T&#x2019;o Tlikahn to T&#x2019;o Baka, where he knew every horse by sight, she was the best, but she would meet some competition here. He felt as if she were his own creation, like the bowguard; at least he had selected her, as he had chosen the soft blue turquoise in the ornament. Little, compact, all black save for the tiny white spot on her forehead, she had the ugly Roman nose of character. She was like an arrow notched to a taut bowstring a movement of the hand would release level flight swiftly to a mark. He was thinking some of these things, half hearing the noises of the people. Just like the prayer, travelling in beauty.&#x2019; It would be good to be a singer as well, to express all these things through the prayers. He would like to know many of them, to learn to conduct the Mountain Chant, and know all the beautiful stories behind the songs and ceremonies inside the Dark Circle of Branches. That would be really on the trail of beauty; to work in silver and turquoise, own soft-moving ponies, and lead the Mountain Chant. Just thinking about it was good. It made him feel cool inside.<br><br> Hozho hogahn ladin nasha woyen . . . In the house of happiness there I wander . . .&#x2019;<br><br> All the time he was passing his hand along the pony&#x2019;s neck, along her back, feeling the lines of tough muscles. E-ya, Grandfather, are you going to dance with the horse?&#x2019; Jesting Squaw&#x2019;s Son called over to him, food is ready.&#x2019; Hakone!&#x2019; He returned abruptly to the quick-moving life of the dance. I can eat it. I did not know you were coming.&#x2019; I came when I heard you were to race your mare. I think there is money to be made, then, and I want to see her race.&#x2019; They went up arm in arm into the crowd, pushing their way into the circle around one of the fires. Busy housewives gave them coffee, the big pot of meat was passed over, and a flat, round loaf of rubbery, filling bread. The meat was the backbone of a yearling calf, boiled with corn. It was good. He munched joyfully, feeling his empty stomach fill, wadding himself with bread, washing it down with bitter coffee. A couple of Americans carrying their own plates dipped in gingerly. A Hopi, having collected everything he could possibly eat, sat down officiously beside them to air his school English and his bourgeois superiority.<br><br> II<br><br>A small drum beating rapidly concentrated the mixed noises into a staccato unison. Young men gathered about the drummer. Laughing Boy might have eaten more, but he left the fire immediately with Jesting Squaw&#x2019;s Son. Some one led off high-pitched at full voice,<br><br> Yo-o galeana, yo-o galeana, yo-o galeana . . .&#x2019;<br><br> By the end of the second word the crowd was with him; more young men hurried up to join the diapason,<br><br> Galeana ena, galeana eno, yo-o ay-e hena ena . . .&#x2019;<br><br> They put their arms over each other&#x2019;s shoulders, swaying in time to the one drum that ran like a dull, glowing thread through the singing, four hundred young men turning loose everything they had. A bonfire twenty feet long flared to the left of them. Opposite, and to the right, the older people sat wrapped in their blankets., Behind them, men crouched in their saddles, heads and shoulders against the night sky, nodding time to the rhythm, silent, with here and there a reflection of firelight on a bit of silver, a dark face, or a horse&#x2019;s eye. Twelve girls in single file stole into the open space, moving quietly and aloof as though the uproar of singing were petrified into a protective wall before it reached them. Only the pulse of the drum showed in their steps. They prowled back and forth before the line of young men, considering them with predatory judgment. Laughing Boy at the back of the crowd looked at them with mild interest; he liked to watch their suave movements and the rich display of blankets and jewelry. One caught his attention; he thought she had on more silver, coral, turquoise, and white shell than he had ever seen on any one person. He speculated on its value horses she must have a very rich mother, or uncles. She was too slender, seeming frail to dance in all that rich, heavy ornamentation. He wished she would move more into the firelight. She was well dressed to show off what she wore; silver and stones with soft highlights and deep shadows glowed against the night-blue velveteen of her blouse; oval plaques of silver were at her waist, and ceremonial jewels in the fringe of her sash. Her blue skirt swung with her short, calculated steps, ankle-length, above the dull red leggins and moccasins with silver buttons. The dark clothing, matching the night, was in contrast to the other dancers, even her blanket was mainly blue. He felt animosity towards her, dark and slight, like a wisp of grass only part of a woman. Her gaze, examining the singers, was too coolly appraising. Now she was looking at him. He threw his head back, losing himself in the singing. He wished he, too, had an American hat. Her mincing steps took her out of sight. Jesting Squaw&#x2019;s Son&#x2019;s arm was over his shoulder, and on the other side another Indian, unknown, but young. Their life flowed together with all those others, complete to themselves, merged in one body of song, with the drumbeats for a heart,<br><br> Yo-o galeana, yo-o galeana . . .&#x2019;<br><br> Song followed song with a rush; when one ended, the next took up, as though the whole night would never suffice to pour out all that was in them. Some one plucked at his blanket; then with another, stronger pull it was snatched from his shoulders. He whirled about. The men near him snickered. The frail girl held his blanket up toward him, mockingly. Ahalani!&#x2019; she greeted him. He stood for a moment in feigned stupidity. He did not want to dance. The devil! Then with a sudden lunge he snatched the blanket. It was no use. She hung on with unexpected strength, digging her heels into the sand, laughing. The men on either side were watching over their shoulders with open joy. What&#x2019;s the matter? I think your feet hurt, perhaps. I think you are bandy-legged, perhaps.&#x2019; Girls didn&#x2019;t usually say these things. He was shocked. Her clear, low voice turned the insults into music, bringing out to the full the rise and fall of a Navajo woman&#x2019;s intonation. All the time they tugged against each other, her long eyes were talking. He had seen girls&#x2019; eyes talk before as they pulled at the blanket, but these were clear as words. He wanted desperately to be back among the men. He nearly pulled her over, but she hung on, and her eyes seemed to be making a fool of him. Suddenly he gave up. She led him around behind the men, not speaking to him, uninterested. He pulled his end of the blanket over his shoulders, assuming the conventional pose of resistance, setting each foot before the other reluctantly, in response to her dragging. He watched her closely, but her grip did not slacken. Out in the clear space she transferred her hands to his belt. He pulled his blanket to his chin, masking enjoyment in a pose of contemptuous tolerance, like the other men dancing there. The solemn turning of the couples contrasted with the free release of the singers: this was a religious ceremony and a rustic, simple pleasure, the happiness of a natural people to whom but few things happen. They were traditional and grave in their revelry. According to the etiquette, whenever there is a rest, the man asks what forfeit he must pay; by the length of time taken by the girl to get down to a reasonable figure, he gages her liking for his company. The music paused an instant for singers to catch their breath. He made a feeble attempt to get away, then asked, How much?&#x2019; Ten cents.&#x2019; The prompt answer astonished him. He paid the forfeit, still staring at her, chagrined, and furious at the blank, correct impassiveness of her face, at the same time noting delicately chiselled features, set of firm lips, long eyes that in their lack of expression were making fun of him. Ten cents! Already! With a splendid gesture he swept his blanket round him, stalking back to the singers. He was set to lose himself in the songs, but he watched the girl drag out a man nearly as tall as himself. Instead of dancing in the usual way, they held each other face to face and close to, each with one hand on the other&#x2019;s shoulder. It was shocking; and why had she not done it with him? But she had let him go the first time he had asked. She had insulted him, she was too thin, and probably ill-behaved.<br></p><h2>Asian America through the Lens: History, Representations, and Identities (Volume 3) (Critical Perspectives on Asian Pacific Americans, 3)</h2><p>While some Asian American films and filmmakers are beginning to achieve acclaim in mainstream U.S. culture, neither academic scholars nor society as a whole has sufficiently taken account of the history of this rich and growing body of cinematic production. In <i>Asian America Through the Lens</i>, Jun Xing accomplishes the colossal task of surveying Asian American cinema for the first time, allowing its aesthetic, cultural, and political diversity and continuities to emerge. Unique insight into Asian American experience in both mainstream and alternative film production is provided by textual analysis as well as by the voices of filmmakers and actors themselves. With constant attention to the specificities of Asian American histories and cultures, Xing engages a broad range of issues and theoretical perspectives, drawing insight from such bodies of scholarship as African American and Latino film studies, Marxian cultural theory, ethnic studies and the politics of representation, and post-structuralist and feminist discourses.</p><p><b>Jun Xing</b> is Professor of Ethnic Studies and Director of the Difference, Power and Discrimination Program at Oregon State University. Trained as a cultural historian, he specializes in U.S. immigration history, American ethnicity, popular culture, and the history of cultural relations between the United States and East Asia. Dr. Xing is the author of <i>Reversing the Lens: Ethnicity, Race, Gender and Sexuality through Film</i>, and <i>Baptized in the Fire of Revolution: The American Social Gospel and the YMCA in China, 1919-1937</i>.The sheer growth in number of Asian American independent films over the past few years requires a comprehensive critical survey of the work that is being generated....There is also a rapidly growing body of critical literature on Asian American film that Xing has mastered well and synthesizes for the reader. The author has 'done his homework' by providing an overview of related work on the topic, and in doing so carves out an important niche for his own contribution. His comparative analysis of the cinema practice of other nondominant groups such as African Americans and Latinos helps greatly in contextualizing Asian American film within the larger framework of marginalization or outright exclusion from the dominant media. (Darrell Y. Hamamoto, University of California, Davis)<br><br>Combining history, cultural studies, and film criticism, Professor Jun Xing has written a masterful review and analysis of Asian American cinema. Concerned with what goes on behind as well as in front of the camera, he deals with the politics and economics as well as aesthetics of Asian American filmmaking. The work probes the complexity of ethnic identity and the protean character of ethnic representations, posing as many questions as it provides answers. (Rudolph J. Vecoli, Immigration History Research Center, University of Minnesota)<br><br>The second half of the book is an uncommonly valuable study (and filmography) of Asian Americans in documentaries, family dramas, and experimental films. The fact that only five or six of the films are as popular as Joy Luck Club&#x2015;most films discussed are 'virtually unknown to the average American'&#x2015;is both the drawback and the value of this book....This is a useful guide to worthwhile movies. (P.H. Stacy, University of Hartford <i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>It's a pleasure to read such a comprehensive and theoretically adept discussion of the emergence and development of an Asian American cinema practice and its attendant, critical discourses. For Xing's study comes at an opportune moment, since it is really needed in the classroom and the ongoing dialog between academics, critics, spectators, and students currently being generated by Asian American filmmaking. <i>Asian American Through the Lens</i> stands as the first project to cover such a broad critical and historical scope in its interrogation of Asian American cinema. Xing's book, then, makes a significant contribution to the broader multicultural project of 'unthinking Eurocentrism,' while defining the parameters of a vital, emergent cinema.

Each volume consists of essays by leading historians who focus on key issues for the period--including society, economy, religion, politics, and culture. The chapters are at once wide-ranging surveys and searching analyses. They are written for the non-specialist but include new and important findings, making them equally valuable for academics across a range of disciplines.<br> <br><em>The Nineteenth Century</em> is the inaugural volume in the series and covers the peak of Britain's world power. The book sets out to describe the force and complexity of that experience, and to cover, in an interdisciplinary way, the political, economic, and cultural history of the British Isles between 1815 and 1901. It looks at the Victorian economy, as well as Victorian public life, as a cultural and political narrative. It includes chapters on women and domesticity; the interplay of religion, intellect, and science; art; architecture and the city; and the literature, theater, and music of the time. The book provides a vivid portrait of this crucial moment in British history and is ideal for both the student of modern history and the general reader.<br></p><p>Colin Matthew-deceased Colin Matthew is Professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford and Editor of the New Dictionary of National Biography.`"Excellent surveys with many fresh insights",'<br>W H Fraser, Professor, University of Strathclyde<br><br>The formula of encouraging experts to contribute a chapter on their own field of speciality results in the reader being treated convincingly to opinions and arguments abreast with current histography s<br><br>`Matthew's Nineteenth Century comes as near to authoritative knowledge as is possible'<br>Richard Davenport-Hines, Times Literary Supplement,</p><h2>Marc Chagall on Art and Culture</h2><p>Marc Chagall (1887-1985) traversed a long route from a boy in the Jewish Pale of Settlement, to a commissar of art in revolutionary Russia, to the position of a world-famous French artist. This book presents for the first time a comprehensive collection of Chagall's public statements on art and culture. The documents and interviews shed light on his rich, versatile, and enigmatic art from within his own mental world. The book raises the problems of a multi-cultural artist with several intersecting identities and the tensions between modernist form and cultural representation in twentieth-century art. It reveals the travails and achievements of his life as a Jew in the twentieth century and his perennial concerns with Jewish identity and destiny, Yiddish literature, and the state of Israel. This collection includes annotations and introductions of the Chagall texts by the renowned scholar Benjamin Harshav that elucidate the texts and convey the changing cultural contexts of Chagall's life.

How can you own the rain and the wind?"</b> <p> So begin the moving words attributed to a great American Indian chief--Chief Seattle--over 100 years ago. They are words that eloquently capture the central belief of Native Americans: that this earth and every creature on it is sacred. It is this belief that inspired Susan Jeffers' extraordinary full-color paintings.</p></p><p>Susan Jeffers is the illustrator of such distinguished picture books as <b>Three Jovial Huntsmen</b>, a Caldecott Honor book; <b>Rachel Field's Hitty</b>; and the ABBY Award-winning <b>Brother Eagle, Sister Sky</b>, which was also a <b>New York Times</b> besteller. She lives in New York.With Native American themes currently in vogue, and environmental awareness a hot issue, this timely picture book scores perfect marks in both arenas. The story is an adaptation of a speech delivered by Chief Seattle at treaty negotiations in the 1850s. Like other great speeches that have stood the test of time, his remarkably relevant message has endured because it comes from the heart and is imbued with passion--here, passion born of love for the land--"This we know: All things are connected like the blood that unites us. / We did not weave the web of life, / We are merely a strand in it. / Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves." Jeffers has paired Seattle's eloquence with her dreamy, meticulous illustrations and the resulting images are haunting. First, readers see Native Americans living in harmony with nature, but gradually the images grow bleaker--ugly swaths of land stripped of their timber. The story comes full circle as a Caucasian family plants new trees on the barren land in a gesture that signifies hope and renewal. Together, Seattle's words and Jeffers's images create a powerful message; this thoughtful book deserves to be pondered and cherished by all.

It is both topical and important. How we resolve (or fail to resolve) the dilemmas of global ethics shapes how we understand ourselves, our relationships with each other and the social and political frameworks of governance now and into the future. This is seen most clearly in the case of climate change, where our actions now determine the environment our grandchildren will inherit, but it is also the case in other areas as our decisions about what it is permissible for humans beings to do to each other determines the type of beings we are. This book, suitable for course use, introduces students to the theory and practice of global ethics, ranging over issues in global governance and citizenship, poverty and development, war and terrorism, bioethics, environmental and climate ethics and gender justice.<br><br></p></p><p><p><strong>Heather Widdows</strong> is Professor of Global Ethics in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Birmingham, UK&nbsp;and Lead Editor of the <i>Journal of Global Ethics</i>.<br><br></p><p>"<i>Global Ethics</i> provides a superb analysis of the ethical issues that arise at the global level. It succeeds in both covering a great deal of ground and in doing so in considerable depth.

Stretching the capacity of the genre to its limits, Achilles' narrative covers adultery, violence, disembowelment, pederasty, virginity-testing, and a conveniently happy ending. Ingenious and sophisticated in conception, <em>Leucippe and Clitophon</em> is at once subtle, stylish, moving, brash, tasteless, and obscene.

He wondered how his students could be expected to remember and understand the many phenomena that social psychologists study? How could they tell what was most important? It was then that he realized a fresh approach to a Social Psychology textbook was needed to structure and integrate student learning; thus, Principles of Social Psychology was born.</p><p></p><h2>Florence Nightingale&#39;s Notes on Nursing and Notes on Nursing for the Labouring Classes: Commemorative Edition with Historical Commentary</h2><p><p><b>Named a 2013 Doody's Core Title!</b></p> <p>This beautiful book bound in red leather includes an in-depth history about each version and the preparation and publishing of Nightingale's works.

Thus began a collaboration which culminated in this extraordinary testament to the beauty of a girl child as witnessed through the lens of her mother&#39;s eye. Never before in the history of photography has an artist of this magnitude photographed her child to such stunning effect. Weaving threads of baroque orientalism, gothic eroticism and surrealist fantasy, these mysterious images might well be controversial, but only if removed from the crucible of &#34;dark love&#34; which so ably contains and ferments them. Ionesco insists &#34;The liberty I took in baring her is innocent....in my gaze the greatest love of all took place&#34; Ionesco&#39;s photographs of her daughter Eva have been widely acclaimed since the 1970&#39;s. &#34;EVA: Eloge de ma Fille&#34; gathers 124 of these images into the definitive volume of Eva photgraphs.</p><p>Irina Ionesco was born to Romanian parents in Paris, 1935. At the age of four she was separated from them and spent her formative years in the city of Constanza, Romania. Steeped in that city&#39;s fabulous riches and fascinating traditions, she returned to Paris first to dance, then to paint, and finally to find her true vocation as photographer of the bizarre and beautiful as they are evoked in women&#39;s erotic mysteries. Ionesco was elected &#34;Woman of the Year&#34;, Time Life Books, 1977, and has over 12 books and countless international exhibitions to her credit. Irina Ionesco currently lives and works in Paris."A virtuoso manipulator of the transgressive feminine erotic.... [Irina Ionesco] has a superlative eye, and some fabulous images result." -- <i>Chris Miller, EUROPEAN PHOTOGRAPHY, No. 76 2005, p.76</i><br><br>"This book is most extraordinary, stunning and captivating. I gave a most positive review" -- <i>Tim Smith, Producer, MEGAPOLITAN, May 28, 2005</i><br><br>"[The ]very fact of the emotional power of the work testifies to its artistic strength....This collection is utterly distinct." -- <i>Christopher Perring, Ph.D., mentalhelp.net, May 19, 2005</i></p><h2>God, the Devil, and Darwin: A Critique of Intelligent Design Theory</h2><p>In the last fifteen years a controversial new theory of the origins of biological complexity and the nature of the universe has been fomenting bitter debates in education and science policy across North America, Europe, and Australia. Backed by intellectuals at respectable universities, <em>Intelligent Design Theory</em> (ID) proposes an alternative to accepted accounts of evolutionary theory: that life is so complex, and that the universe is so fine-tuned for the appearance of life, that the only plausible explanation is the existence of an intelligent designer. For many ID theorists, the designer is taken to be the god of Christianity. <br> <br> Niall Shanks has written the first accessible introduction to, and critique of, this controversial new intellectual movement. Shanks locates the growth of ID in the last two decades of the twentieth century in the growing influence of the American religious right. But as he shows, its roots go back beyond Aquinas to Ancient Greece. After looking at the historical roots of ID, Shanks takes a hard look at its intellectual underpinnings, discussing modern understandings of thermodynamics, and how self-organizing processes lead to complex physical, chemical, and biological systems. He considers cosmological arguments for ID rooted in so-called "anthropic coincidences" and also tackles new biochemical arguments for ID based on "irreducible biological complexity." Throughout he shows how arguments for ID lack cohesion, rest on errors and unfounded suppositions, and generally are grossly inferior to evolutionary explanations. <br> <br> While ID has been proposed as a scientific alternative to evolutionary biology, Shanks argues that ID is in fact "old creationist wine in new designer label bottles" and moreover is a serious threat to the scientific and democratic values that are our cultural and intellectual inheritance from the Enlightenment.</p><p><br><strong>Niall Shanks</strong>, a native of England, earned his Ph.D. at the University of Alberta, Canada. He is currently Curtis D. Gridley Professor in the History and Philosophy of Science at Wichita State University.<br>University professor Shanks is an impassioned defender of evolution. He is animated by the progress he believes evolution's critics are making in injecting creationism into American society, particularly into schools. His opponents' recent books, rarely reviewed in the press, provide Shanks' sounding board here, especially titles by Phillip E. Johnson, Michael Behe, and William Dembski. Collectively, they are the leading lights of the so-called intelligent-design theory, which front-rank Darwinist Richard Dawkins, in the foreword, indicts as "pernicious nonsense which needs to be neutralized before irreparable damage is done to American education." Although Dawkins may be crediting intelligent-design advocates with undue influence, Shanks zealously prosecutes the case against them. He focuses on their main precepts, such as claims that biochemistry possesses an "irreducible complexity" and, therefore, a nonmaterial component, or that thermodynamics refutes evolution. For communities with curriculum concerns about creationism versus evolution. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This is a God who transcends our understanding and is unknowable except by divine revelation-the God described by the author of Hebrews as "a consuming fire." </p><p>But the church has reduced this God of glory to more manageable proportions. We have trivialized the God of glory. "Visit an average congregation on a Sunday morning," proposes Donald McCullough, "and you will likely find a congregation comfortably relating to a deity who fits nicely within precise doctrinal positions, or who lends almighty support to social crusades, or who conforms to individual spiritual experiences. But you will not likely find much awe." The result is a diminished influence of the church on the world around it-a sad reflection of the manageable deity we have put in God's place. </p><p>Donald McCullough calls us to abandon the fleeting comfort of our substitute gods and embrace the God of the Bible: a God far more powerful, exciting, loving, and unfathomable than any image of God we can conjure up. Those who know and follow this God are different-a people transformed by a holy God into a holy, worshiping, loving, community that reveals an awesome God to a needy world. </p><p>"Don McCullough knows the difference betweeen Christ and culture and shows us how to tell the difference. His sharply articulated insights guard us from foolish religion and silly spirituality, both of which are epidemic in our land. A most welcome book: sane, incisive, prophetic."-Eugene H. Peterson, professor of spiritual theology at Regent College in Vancouver, B.C. and author of The Message: New Testament with Psalms and Proverbs </p><p>"Donald McCullough helps us discern our faults and foibles in the community of faith. He names our idolatries with relentless precision. But there is nothing mean-spirited about his attack. With compassion and humor he leads the reader to the mystery, hilarity, and joy at the heart of the Gospel. God's generosity, humility, and availability to us in Christ is the thread running through the book which enables us to face our failure with the renewed conviction that God hasn't finished with us yet!"-Alan Jones, dean of Grace Cathedral, San Francisco, California </p><p>"What J.B. Phillips did for his generation in Your God is Too Small, Donald McCullough has done for our generation. This is a courageous, tough-minded, truth-telling challenge helpful to skeptics, seekers, and saints alike. I strongly recommend it."-Roberta Hestenes, professor of Christian spirituality, Eastern College, St. Davids, Pennsylvania </p><p>"McCullough's compelling new book startled me with its exposure of my sneaky devices for managing my God. It is, I believe, God's own most urgent word for Christians and churches today: 'Let Me be the Lord and Maker that I am.' This book awakens us to our tricks with a clarity, a concreteness, and a kindness that makes us glad to come to our senses."-Lewis B. Smedes, senior professor of ethics, Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasedena, California </p><p>"Be careful-reading this book may shake you to your roots as it shook me, crashing in on my facile, comfortable assumptions about Christian faith, and revealing to me the extravagant love of our un-domesticated God. In this profoundly disturbing, cleansing, radically biblical work I found a new lens through which to see Deity and reality."-Luci Shaw, author of God in the Dark, Writing the River, and writer in residence at Regent College, Vancouver, B.C. </p><p>"In a lively, vividly illustrated book, Donald McCullough challenges our contemporary idolatries, recalling us to the adventure of Christian worship and praise of the living God."-William H. Willimon, dean of the chapel, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina </p><p>"This book speaks to our premier human problem-idolatry and its consequences. Donald McCullough's deep learning, wide reading, clear thinking, and firm faith combine to expose our folly and show us not just the better but the only way to live-in the worship of the One who is Holy Love."-David A. Hubbard, president emeritus, Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasedena, California </p><p>"About once every ten years, a book is published that must be added to the genre of prophetic literature. Such is the dynamic power of the Trivialization of God. With the passion of a prophet, Donald McCullough fires words like bullets, piercing our shabby certainties about the nature of God and inviting us to prostrate ourselves in hushed trembling and speechless humility before the God revealed by and in Jesus of Nazareth."-Brennan Manning, author of The Ragamuffin Gospel and Abba's Child </p><p>"Don McCullough writes about a God who is real, authentic, and available to us in Jesus Christ. He shows us the way to authentic faith out of the ethos of a tinsel age. This is a must book for anyone who is serious about the journey of faith."-W. Frank Harrington, senior minister, Peachtree Presbyterian Church, Atlanta, Georgia </p><p>"Don't be misled by the title. This book isn't mostly about us and what we have done to God-turning Him into a lot of trivial godlets. It's really about God-the Holy God, totally Other and totally Love-and what He does to us."-Dr. Elizabeth Achtemeier, Union Theological Seminary, Richmond, Virginia</p></p><p>DR. DONALD W.

They are the ones who create the complexities and individual nuances that make jazz so difficult to categorize and chronicle. Including pertinent biographical information, <i>Introduction to Jazz History</i> continues to examine this interaction between musicians, their history, and the history of their music. </p> <p> The Sixth Edition updates current and ongoing stylistic trends in jazz, including the modern big bands and the new hybrids of jazz extending beyond fusion and crossover. The chronological presentation of the history is intuitive and logical. New biographical sketches for recent and historical musicians have been added to update the text. </p> <p> Interactive Listening Guides are now available using the CDs that accompany the text and the CDs for SCCJ (Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz). Together, these two sets comprise the most powerful collection of jazz recordings available in such a simple package and they are now fully interactive. A fully developed online course of Jazz History using this textbook is now available. For information go to www.eMegill.com </p><p> The people who play jazz create the complexities and individual nuances that make a history of jazz so difficult to formulate. No clear-cut category can encompass all jazz. Each performer's idiom is a style unto itself; if it were not so, the music would hardly be jazz. </p> <p> Jazz, like almost all other music, comprises three artistic activities: creating, performing, and listening. In traditional Western European music, these three activities are not always performed by the same individual, although they quite often are. In jazz, however, it is necessary for the performer to combine all three at the same time. Musical creation is an active part of any jazz performance and depends on the performers' understanding of the developing creation, an understanding gained only by their ability to listen well. They must react instantaneously to what they hear from their fellow performers, and their own contribution must be consistent with the unfolding themes and moods. Every act of musical creation in jazz is, therefore, as individual as the performer creating it. </p> <p> Jazz occupies a unique place in American cultural history. Although it has been influenced by the music of many countries, it remains a purely American phenomenon. And because the creators of jazz, the performers, have been influenced by social and historical forces peculiar to America, an understanding of their life experiences and lifestyles is often essential. </p> <p> It is almost impossible to present a history of jazz without looking closely at its great performers. Although we are concerned mainly with the music itself, the various styles can often be seen to have grown directly out of the substance of the performers' lives, and we have therefore given whatever biographical information is necessary to understand a musician's development. </p> <p> Looking over the historical span of jazz, we cannot say one performer is more important than another, and we have had a difficult time choosing which performers to discuss. We have selected certain individuals for special biographical treatment because they stand out as leaders in the development of a particular jazz style. We have necessarily had to exclude a number of significant artists. Furthermore, we have gone into detail in the biographies of some musicians, not because they are more important than others, but because their lives have been bound up with the lives of so many other musicians. Such an approach allows us to examine many interesting interactions between musicians who have determined the direction of jazz over the years. Nevertheless, the subject of this book is jazz, not life histories, and we include biographical detail only to the extent that it illuminates the music. </p> <p> This edition updates several of the ongoing stylistic trends in jazz today, including the strong historical influence of Latin music to modern big bands and salsa bands, bebop, and crossover. The new hybrids of American music have been added to the end of the text. New biographical sketches for recent and historical musicians have been added for balance and to provide background for the discussions of style. The overview appendix on rock has been expanded for a better understanding of its influence on contemporary jazz styles. </p> <p><b>SPECIAL FEATURES</b></p> <p> The book's format is best suited to students and professors concerned with the chronology of jazz styles and how they have influenced one another. The chapters are organized so that professors may include additional biographies and recordings. It is also possible to schedule short-term classes by using only the first chapters of each part for class discussion. </p> <p> <b> <i>Listening Guides and Recordings.</i></b><i> </i> Discussions of each stylistic period appear at the beginning of each chapter, and most of them are accompanied by a Listening Guide of a specific performance. For the sake of convenience, most of the recordings come from the <i>Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz (SCCJ).</i> This excellent collection is still available to students. Furthermore, it contains extensive explanatory notes by historian Martin Williams that add much to its effectiveness. Every recording featured in a Listening Guide is labeled so it can be located in the collection. For this edition, several Listening Guides for selections from SCCJ have been added, where appropriate, at the end of each part of the text. The Listening Guides are intentionally kept brief and point out musical landmarks. They have proven successful in the classroom because they leave professors free to help students draw their own aesthetic conclusions from the music. The guides have been designed primarily to help students at any level discipline their listening. A suggested discography appears at the end of each chapter to further augment the students' listening experience. </p> <p> This edition again stresses the importance of listening by adding several new Listening Guides. There are 70 Listening Guides. By using the <i>Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz</i> (five CDs) and the supplementary two tapes or CDs that accompany this text, there will be very little need to secure albums to facilitate examples for the Listening Guides. </p> <p> <b> <i>Box Biographies.</i></b><i> </i> Within the flow of the discussion, short biographical boxes appear that relate to the topic but not directly to the specific subject. In this way, background information can be presented without interruption. </p> <p> <b> <i>Student Study Bids.</i></b><i> </i> Several other study aids are included to help prepare the student for the course: "The Elements of Music for the Nonmusician" and "The Elements of Jazz." The first is intended to supply the necessary rudiments of music to students who have little or no music background. The second presents specific musical elements in jazz and illustrates them with several examples; it also defines many of the jazz terms used throughout the book. </p> <p> <b> <i>Student Tapes/CDs.</i></b><i> </i> The recordings that accompany the text serve two purposes. First, the instructor can make listening assignments knowing that the recorded examples are immediately accessible-that is, in the Smithsonian collection and the student collection. The second purpose is to supply more contemporary examples for the students to have after the course is finished. </p> <p> <b> <i>Glossary.</i></b><i> </i> Glossary terms are printed in bold type at least once in the text for easy identification and are readily found again in the extensive glossary at the back of the book. </p> <p> <b> <i>Teacher's Manual.</i></b><i> </i> Brief summaries of each chapter, topics for classroom discussion, and a bank of questions from which to construct exams are provided in a teacher's manual and will help the professor better use the material in the text. For this edition, additional listening guides are available in the teacher's manual. </p> <p> <b> <i>Online Activities.</i></b><i> </i> Interactive listening software is now available to access the Listening Guides on the two-CD series that accompanies the text. This software allows the student to move anywhere in the listening example with just a mouse click on the description. There is additional background material on both the performer and the music and an interactive glossary. These interactive listening guides and an explanation on the necessary plugins are found on the author's homepage <b>http://www.miracosta.edu/home/ddmegill/</b> </p> <p> This course is also now available as a fully loaded course for teaching online. All assignments, tests, and grading are presented in a course management software environment (ETUDES). All material can be modified or taught just as it is. Contact the author at the above homepage for information and demonstration. </p> <p><b>TO THE STUDENT</b></p> <p> As a student of jazz styles, you must keep one activity foremost in your studies: You must actively listen to the examples and observe the differences that identify each style. Reading and discussion alone will not convey the essence of the various styles. Only listening does, and listening requires total attention; approach jazz as you would any other serious musical art. Your appreciation of jazz and understanding of its history will be enhanced greatly by continued listening and reading about how jazz styles were born, grew, and changed. </p></p><h2>International Law Frameworks, 3rd Edition (Concepts and Insights)</h2><p>In this comprehensive examination of international law, you&#39;ll find in-depth, substantive discussion supported by expert analysis and commentary, case citations, statutes, and court rules.

Representative topics include treaties, international environmental law, human rights, jurisdictional immunities, and laws of war.</p><p></p><h2>Lessons on the Analytic of the Sublime (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)</h2><p>Philosophical aesthetics has seen an amazing revival over the past decade, as a radical questioning of the very grounds of Western epistemology has revealed that some antinomies of aesthetic experience&#x2015;and in particular of the limits of the aesthetical&#x2015;can be viewed as a general, yet necessarily open model for human understanding. In this revival, no text in the classical corpus of Western philosophy has been more frequently discussed than the complex paragraphs modestly inserted into Kant's <i>Critique of Judgment</i> as sections 23-29: the Analytic of the Sublime.<br>This book is a rigorous <i>explication de texte</i>, a close reading of these sections. First, Lyotard reconstitutes, following the letter of Kant's analysis, the philosophical context of his critical writings and of the European Enlightenment. Second, because the analytic of the sublime reveals the inability of aesthetic experience to bridge the separate realms of theoretical and practical reason, Lyotard can connect his reconstitution of Kant's critical project with today's debates about the very conditions&#x2015;and limits&#x2015;of presentation in general.<br>Lyotard enables us to see the sublime as a model for reflexive thinking generally via his concept of the "differend," which emphasizes the inevitability of conflicts and incompatibilities between different notions and "phrases." The Analytic of the Sublime, he points out, tries to argue that human thought is always constituted through a similar incompatibility between different intellectual and affective faculties. These lessons thus highlight the analysis of a "differend of feeling" in Kant's text, which is also the analysis of a "feeling of differend," and connect this feeling with the transport that leads all thought (critical thought included) to its limits.</p><p>In this revival, no text in the classical corpus of Western philosophy has been more frequently discussed than the complex paragraphs modestly inserted into Kant&#39;s Critique Of Judgment as sections 23-29: the Analytic of the Sublime.

Wade, Updated</h2><p><i>Liberty and Sexuality</i> is a definitive account of the legal and political struggles that created the right to privacy and won constitutional protection for a woman's right to choose abortion.<br><br><i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that established that right, grew out of not only efforts to legalize abortion but also out of earlier battles against statutes that criminalized birth control. When the U.S. Supreme Court in 1965, in <i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i>, voided such a prohibition as an outrageous intrusion upon marital privacy, it opened a previously unimagined constitutional door: the opportunity to argue that a woman's access to a safe, legal abortion was also a fundamental constitutional right.<br><br>Garrow's essential history details both the unheralded contributions of the young lawyers who filed America's first abortion rights cases and also the inside-the-Supreme Court deliberations that produced <i>Roe v. Wade</i>.<br><br>In this updated and expanded paperback edition, Garrow also traces the post-Roe evolution of abortion rights battles and the wider struggle for sexual privacy up through the 25th anniversary of <i>Roe</i> in early 1998.</p><p>In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court case <i>Roe v. Wade</i> legalized abortion in America. The somewhat shaky scaffold supporting that decision drew together social struggles; the rights of women, physicians, and the state; and a slew of earlier cases on birth control and sexuality that had crafted a right to privacy never written into the Constitution. The vast size of David J. Garrow's gloriously sprawling <i>Liberty and Sexuality</i> allows him to tease out the miniscule fibers that would eventually be woven into <i>Roe</i>. While heavy hitters like Margaret Sanger and Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun are well drawn, it's the bit players who really have a chance to shine here. When James G. Morris, a Roman Catholic father of five, reads in the newspapers about a birth control clinic violating an antiquated Connecticut law in the 1960s, he doggedly calls police, prosecutor, and mayor until a reluctant investigation is kicked off. Marie Wilson Tindall, who had been to the clinic, agrees to have her testimony and contraband contraceptive jelly duly entered into the record to start a landmark court battle that would lay the foundation for <i>Roe</i>. And over the years, a veritable army of legal scholars, law clerks, judges, and regular citizens took part in an increasingly acrimonious debate over reproductive rights and free expression of sexuality. Well-crafted prose and meticulous journalistic footwork make this a definitive book for anyone intrigued by the ponderous mechanisms of legal and social change. <i>--Francesca Coltrera</i><b>David J.

The Japanese army, beleaguered and knowing that Okinawa was the Americans' last stepping-stone to their homeland, dug in against the largest amphibious force of the Pacific campaign.</p><p>The Battle for Okinawa is a unique account of this critical engagement. Hiromichi Yahara was Senior Staff Officer of the 32nd Army and the highest-ranking Japanese officer to leave Okinawa alive. His personal record of the fateful conflict is a story that could be told by no one else, a gripping account of the battle and an eye-opening look inside the Japanese high command.</p><p>Yahara's military perspective placed him at odds with many of his fellow officers. He had spent two years in America as an exchange officer, spoke some English, and did not share the romantic, samurai-influenced ideals of his superiors. He was a rational and practical strategist. From the outset, it was Yahara's belief that the poorly supplied and outgunned Japanese were doomed to defeat at Okinawa. His plan was to abandon the aggressive, attack-oriented warfare the Japanese had typically engaged in for a defensive war of attrition, inflicting maximum casualties and buying the Imperial Army precious time to prepare for the defense of the mainland. Ignored at first, his strategy was eventually adopted after a disastrous counteroffensive left the Japanese too weak to pursue any alternative.</p><p>As Yahara predicted, the Americans were victorious, but at a great cost. The land was wooded and hilly, and the Japanese, entrenched in caves and dugouts that honeycombed the island, were almost impossible to dislodge despite the constant aerial and artillery bombardment unleashed upon them. For over three months they held on, spurning the chance to surrender and choosing to fight to the last man.</p><p>The terrible battle claimed the lives of more than 12,500 American soldiers and over ten times that many Japanese and Okinawans.</p><p>Yahara, the highest-ranking officer to escape death on the battlefield at Okinawa and not commit hara-kiri, was accused of dishonor and betrayal. He wrote this book twenty-seven years later to set the record straight. Editor and Japan expert Frank B. Gibney, an intelligence specialist attached to the 10th Army in Okinawa who interrogated Yahara following his capture, has written an introduction and commentary that provide both a historical context and a personal counterpoint to Yahara's narrative.</p><p>Hiromichi Yahara's account is the first available in English from the Japanese perspective. It is an extraordinary document.</p><p>"Powerful...poignant..."-The New York Times Book Review</p><p>Colonel Hiromichi Yahara was one of the best of the Imperial Army's strategists. He had the classic staff officer's cool, analytic approach to warfare. The "charge the foe"offensive tactics, which characterized most Japanese Army operations in the Pacific, were not his style. The ultimate test of his skill and vision was at Okinawa, in the last campaign of World War II.</p><p>Yahara's remarkable memoir tells the story of the Imperial Army in the process of dissolution, of thousands of soldiers locked in the desperate attempt to escape or die fighting. Never before available in English, it movingly chronicles Yahara's personal story of conflict between rational plans and emotional patriotism, and presents an illuminating window into the final anguish of the Japanese high command.</p>COLONEL HIROMICHI YAHARA was the senior staff officer of the 32nd Japanese Army at Okinawa.<p>FRANK B.

The book contained legal briefs, pamphlets, and letters relating to a case that had been tried in 1698 involving a child bride, a disguised priest, a triple murder, four hangings and the beheading of a nobleman. Browning resolved to use it as the source for a poem. The result, <em>The Ring and the Book</em>, is certainly one of the most important long poems of the Victorian era and is arguably Browning&#x2019;s greatest work. </p> <p> Basing their edition on the 1888&#x2013;89 version of the poem, Altick and Collins include the last corrections Browning intended before his death.

Zooarchaeology, the study of animal remains found at archaeological sites, is interdisciplinary in nature, requiring students and researchers to not only master the technical skills of identifying fragmentary bones and teeth but also to develop a deep understanding of the taxonomy, natural history, behavior, and ecology of the species identified. Until now, these topics have always been treated separately. This book is the only field guide and laboratory manual to combine animal ecology and natural history with the detailed osteology of all the vertebrate classes (fishes, amphibians, birds, and mammals) and all the primary orders native to western North America. Skeletal images are shown at a variety of magnifications and views and are accompanied by photographs of the animals in their characteristic habitats.&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Jack M.

His own life was as astonishing as any of his novels: born in the Ukraine of Polish parents, after a childhood in exile and a 20-year career as a merchant seaman, he began in middle age to write in English, the language of his newly adopted country. <br> <em>The Oxford Reader's Companion to Conrad</em> represents a unique and long-overdue achievement in Conrad scholarship: the first comprehensive and authoritative reference to distil in a lively, readable way a vast range of information on Joseph Conrad's life, works, reputation, and the historical and cultural contexts in which he lived. Much of the material in the <em>Companion</em> is entirely new, compiled from scattered Conrad resources, many of which have never been published before.<br> Produced by two of the world's leading Conradians, with the help of specialist contributors, here are the latest findings of modern scholarship captured in an unparalleled resource for all Conrad enthusiasts.</p><p>Owen Knowles, Senior Lecturer, Department of English, University of Hull. Gene Moore, Senior Lecturer in English, University of Amsterdam.Reviewed with The Oxford Reader's Companion to Hardy.<p>In 1999, Oxford introduced a new branch of its esteemed family of Oxford Companions with the publication of <i>Oxford Reader's Com</i> panion to Dickens [RBB O 1 99] and <i>Oxford Reader's Companion to Trollope</i> (1999). Reflecting the general format of the previous volumes, these two new compilations cover not only the authors' lives and works but also the social, cultural, and political milieu in which they lived. Thus, the alphabetically arranged entries range from lengthy treatments of each author's publications, to family members, friends, and associates, to places, ideas, and events that had a significant influence on their lives or that figured prominently in their writings. In addition, both volumes include articles that offer valuable overviews of the major critical and biographical studies available on each writer. A significant difference is that only the volume on Conrad also includes entries for major characters.The more than 400 entries in the Conrad companion were authored by Knowles and Moore (both noted Conrad scholars) and four additional contributors, while the 320 entries in the Hardy companion are the work of Page, who is a prominent and prolific authority on English literature, and an international team of 42 scholars. Both volumes include black-and-white illustrations, author chronologies, and useful indexes that arrange entry headings under broad subject categories. The Conrad companion also contains an index of references to his works, a family tree, and a section of maps; and the Hardy companion features five appendixes, ranging from an index to his poems to a list of media adaptations, the latter of which is disappointing in its incompleteness. Both volumes could have benefited from a more generous use of <i>see</i> references; for instance, neither companion refers users from <i>Evolution</i> to <i>Darwinism</i> or from <i>World War I</i> to <i>First World </i> War.<i>Oxford Reader's Companion to Conrad</i> is the first truly encyclopedic work devoted to Conrad. It complements Leonard Orr and Ted Billy's recent <i>A Joseph Conrad Companion</i> (Greenwood, 1999), which is a collection of 14 essays that survey the biographical and critical scholarship on Conrad, and it provides both broader and more in-depth coverage of Conrad's life and works than does Norman Page's <i>A Conrad Companion</i> (St. Martin's, 1986). Because <i>Oxford </i> Reader's Companion to Hardy does not include separate entries for Hardy's characters, earlier guides to Hardy, such as F. B. Pinion's <i>A </i> Hardy Companion (Macmillan, 1976) and Glenda Leeming's <i>Who's </i> Who in Thomas Hardy (Taplinger, 1975), continue to be useful resources for Hardy scholars.Reflecting the high scholarly standards and readability that one has come to expect of an Oxford Companion, these volumes are highly recommended for all academic libraries and for larger public libraries.

Includes the most comprehensive entries on major philosophers, 400 new entries including over 50 on preeminent contemporary philosophers, extensive coverage of rapidly developing fields such as the philosophy of mind and applied ethics, more entries on non-Western philosophy than any comparable volume, and increased coverage of Continental philosophy.</p><p>"The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy is very comprehensive, thoroughly up-to-date, and probably the best short reference book in English on philosophy."

Superbly cross-referenced and meticulously edited it will also provide students and teachers with leads to follow, and guides for further reading and research." Edward Said, Columbia University<br><br>"Elegantly-written and thoughtfully compiled, the Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy is an essential reference work for any humanist's library. An accessible digest of even the most complex ideas central to the Western philosophical tradition, the Dictionary is a remarkably useful introduction to the history of ideas and to the thinkers who have been so passionate about these ideas." Henry Louis Gates, Jr.<br><br>"The first edition of this comprehensive yet concise dictionary quickly established itself as one of the preeminent reference sources in the field. The second edition is significantly larger, including 400 new entries, many on non-Western and non-European philosophy. A noteworthy change from the first edition is the inclusion of some 50 entries on living philosophers, and much attention has been paid to rapidly developing fields such as bioethics and political philosophy. Many of the existing entries have been expanded (e.g., the entry "postmodern" is some 50 percent longer than in the previous edition). A collaborative work of truly international scope, the dictionary is both indispensable both for the range of subjects covered and for the lucidity of the writing." J. R.

Taken together, the verses form a key body of teaching within Buddhism, a guiding voice along the struggle-laden path towards true enlightenment, or Nirvana. However, the appeal of these epithets of wisdom extends beyond its religious heritage to a general and universal spirituality. <br> This edition provides an introduction and notes which examine the impact that the text has had within the Buddhist heritage through the centuries.</p><p>John Carter is at Colgate University, New York.

Although there were many preparation materials in the market, we found that none of them offered a comprehensive solution to prepare for the exam. Some books offered practice questions only, while others offered a general test-taking course but lacked sufficient specific information targeted to the FSOT. <br><br> The Adar Review materials were prepared by successful candidates who passed the CFA Exam, the FSOT and the FSOA.

Although it is not possible to provide all the information that you need to pass the exam in one volume as much of the materials for the exam will be based on current affairs, the coverage of which is beyond the scope of this material, we have prepared a reading list that is much shorter and more focused than the list provided by the Department of State, which we consider far too extensive to be useful in you preparation.

Over the past 30 years, he has helped set direction for some of our most influential conservation organizations, served as editor and publisher of key conservation journals, and shared with readers his unique style and outlook in widely acclaimed books including The Big Outside and Confessions of an Eco-Warrior.<br><br>In Rewilding North America, Dave Foreman takes on arguably the biggest ecological threat of our time: the global extinction crisis. He not only explains the problem in clear and powerful terms, but also offers a bold, hopeful, scientifically credible, and practically achievable solution.<br><br>Foreman begins by setting out the specific evidence that a mass extinction is happening and analyzes how humans are causing it. Adapting Aldo Leopold's idea of ecological wounds, he details human impacts on species survival in seven categories, including direct killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, exotic species, and climate change. Foreman describes recent discoveries in conservation biology that call for wildlands networks instead of isolated protected areas, and, reviewing the history of protected areas, shows how wildlands networks are a logical next step for the conservation movement. The final section describes specific approaches for designing such networks (based on the work of the Wildlands Project, an organization Foreman helped to found) and offers concrete and workable reforms for establishing them. The author closes with an inspiring and empowering call to action for scientists and activists alike.<br><br>Rewilding North America offers both a vision and a strategy for reconnecting, restoring, and rewilding the North American continent, and is an essential guidebook for anyone concerned with the future of life on earth.<br></p><p><p>Dave Foreman is Director of The Rewilding Institute, a non-profit conservation think tank based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which is dedicated to developing and promoting the ideas, strategies, and vision of continental-scale conservation. </p><p></p><p></p>"Foreman somehow manages to be comprehensive, historically informed, accurate, and succinct. This makes the book surprisingly well suited to serve as a text for introductory courses in ecology or conservation biology.

Wise for her years, Vanessa reveals much about the adult world in which she lives.<br> <br> "Vanessa rebels against the dominance of age; she watches [her grandfather] imitate her aunt Edna; and her rage at times is such that she would gladly kick him. It takes great skill to keep this story within the expanding horizon of this young girl and yet make it so revealing of the adult world."&#x2014;<i>Atlantic</i><br> <br> "<i>A Bird in the House</i> achieves the breadth of scope which we usually associate with the novel (and thereby is as psychologically valid as a good novel), and at the same time uses the techniques of the short story form to reveal the different aspects of the young Vanessa." &#x2014;Kent Thompson, <i>The Fiddlehead</i><br> <br> "I am haunted by the women in Laurence's novels as if they really were alive&#x2014;and not as women I've known, but as women I've been."&#x2014;Joan Larkin, <i>Ms. Magazine</i><br> <br> "Not since . . . <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> has there been a novel like this.

She translated Somali poetry and prose during this time, and began her career as a fiction writer with stories set in Africa.<br><br>When Laurence returned to Canada in 1957, she settled in Vancouver, where she devoted herself to fiction with a Ghanaian setting: in her first novel, <i>This Side Jordan</i>, and in her first collection of short fiction, <i>The Tomorrow-Tamer</i>. Her two years in Somalia were the subject of her memoir, <i>The Prophet&#x2019;s Camel Bell</i>.<br><br>Separating from her husband in 1962, Laurence moved to England, which became her home for a decade, the time she devoted to the creation of five books about the fictional town of Manawaka, patterned after her birthplace, and its people: <i>The Stone Angel</i>, <i>A Jest of God</i>, <i>The Fire-Dwellers</i>, <i>A Bird in the House</i>, and <i>The Diviners</i>.<br><br>Laurence settled in Lakefield, Ontario, in 1974.

The inexperienced and impetuous young nobleman Pyotr Grinyev is sent on military service to a remote fortress, where he falls in love with Masha, Captain Mironov's daughter &#x2013; but then the ruthless Cossack Pugachov lays siege to the stronghold, setting in motion a tragic train of events.</p><p>This volume also contains another work by Pushkin on the same theme, A History of Pugachov, which presents an impartial, meticulously researched history of the revolt, but was regarded in aristocratic circles as subversive on its publication. Together, these two works provide a fascinating insight into the character of the peasant who tried to overthrow an empress, written with the clarity and insight of Russia's greatest poet.</p></p><p>Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837) was a dramatist and poet, penning such influential works as Eugene Onegin and Boris Godunov.

It's a precarious time, with challenging academics, pressing social issues, and the prospect of college looming. Parents can now breathe easy: this guide calms the teen-time jitters and even offers hope to those just turning to homeschooling now that their child is about to enter high school. With brief "how we did it" testimonies from other parents sprinkled throughout the book, author Cafi Cohen offers sage advice with the turn of every page. A columnist for <i>Home Education Magazine</i> and <i>Homeschooling Today</i>, two of the most respected periodicals on the subject, Cohen has also homeschooled her two children into college. To comfort doubters, she begins with 10 reasons for homeschooling your teenager (work experience, limited peer pressure, and family togetherness, among them). She goes on to devote long chapters to traditional subjects such as math and history, and even gets to those you might not have considered, like driver education. Her suggestions for parents new to homeschooling: decompress slowly, study only one subject a month at first, and read at least one book on learning styles. This approach will save much time and reduce those trial-and-error episodes.<p> The guide is neatly packaged and easy to read in the same style of its sister publications, <i>Homeschooling: The Early Years</i> and <i>Homeschooling: The Middle Years</i>. A large collection of lists and quick tips offer everything from the top&nbsp;10 books for teens and the most popular math programs to money-saver suggestions such as joining a local college's foreign-language club and asking for discarded equipment from local schools. The last chapter contains two college application essays written by teenage homeschoolers. It also provides reassuring information about diplomas. Many universities follow Harvard's policy of not requiring a diploma, but if you or your homeschooling support group do issue one, your teenager can answer "yes" to the diploma question on most job applications--a fact sure to illicit a collective sigh of relief from thousands of parents who homeschool their teens. <i>--Jodi Mailander Farrell</i></p>Discover the Rewards of Homeschooling Your Teen</p><h2>Skeletal Muscle: Form and Function - 2nd Edition</h2><p><p><i>Skeletal Muscle: Form and Function, Second Edition,</i> provides readers with a detailed understanding of the different facets of muscle physiology.

And what a pity that is: a dash of curiosity is all it takes to stumble upon treasures we never expected.&#39; A shy young man leaves his home in rural Turkey to learn a trade in 1920s Berlin. The city&#39;s crowded streets, thriving arts scene, passionate politics and seedy cabarets provide the backdrop for a chance meeting with a woman, which will haunt him for the rest of his life. Emotionally powerful, intensely atmospheric and touchingly profound, Madonna in a Fur Coat is an unforgettable novel about new beginnings and the unfathomable nature of the human soul. &#39;Passionate but clear . . . Ali&#39;s success [is in ] his ability to describe the emergence of a feeling, seemingly straightforward from the outside but swinging back and forth between opposite extremes at its core, revealing the tensions that accompanies such rise and fall.&#39; Atilla �zkirimli, writer and literary historian</p><p>Sabahattin Ali was born in 1907 in the Ottoman town of Egridere (now Ardino in southern Bulgaria) and was killed on the Bulgarian border in 1948 as he attempted to leave Turkey.

Short, moving and memorable: reading it is like taking a literary minibreak. -- Fiona Wilson * The Times * Its prose sparkles with the friction between eastern conservatism and western decadence. This is above all a tale of young love and disenchantment, of missed opportunities and passion&#39;s elusive, flickering flame . . . a little reminiscent of Turgenev&#39;s First Love, with a hero every bit as gauche, and a twist every bit as bitter. -- Toby Lichtig * Financial Times * A gorgeously melancholic romance . . . a cautionary tale certain to beguile. -- Eileen Battersby * The Irish Times * A poignant coming-of-age tale, drenched in disillusionment. The gap between hope and reality, art and ordinary life, has been explored in many other novels, but rarely with the unaffected simplicity of Madonna in a Fur Coat . . .The translation by Maureen Freely and Alexander Dawe is crisp, capturing Ali&#39;s directness and clarity of language. -- William Armstrong * Times Literary Supplement * Offsets inter-war Berlin&#39;s decadent dazzle with bouts of shade, murk and melancholy . . . recreates a vanished era and dramatises a doomed relationship, and does so with verve, depth and poignancy. The result is a miniature masterpiece. -- Malcolm Forbes * The National *</p><h2>The Lost Son: A Life in Pursuit of Justice</h2><p>An intimate portrait of the courageous and honorable fortieth Police Commissioner of New York City details his mission to fight the injustice around him and to solve the mystery of his own mother, who abandoned him forty-one years ago.</p><p>Bernard B.

And yet there is no more fundamental human invention than the wheel&#x2014;a rotational mechanism that accomplishes what our physical form cannot.

He spins an 11-part tale of circular motion that ranges from rotation in biology to rotation driven by biology. Vogel captivates with discussions of engineering feats rooted in circular motion &#x2014; from plodding horses turning shallow paddle wheels to gears that drive sixteenth-century reading machines &#x2014; and doesn't stint on his trademark puns and word-play. Mixing findings in his own field with those from mechanics, dynamics and historical analysis, he creates a delightful perspective on the wonders of whirl. There is even a bonus chapter on how to make simple rotational models, including an entertaining but difficult-to-use drill.

It may sound more like pilates than technology, but <i>Why the Wheel Is Round</i> takes us deep into the world of biomechanics&#x2014;in essence how muscles pulling on bones allow us to carry out tasks and how biological materials like wood, horn and shell fit them for toolmaking.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Engineering and Technology</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Posthumously published,<i> Why the Wheel Is Round</i> was written by Vogel (1940&#x2013;2015), a celebrated researcher and author in the field of biomechanics. He focuses on the intersection of biology (specifically the physics of muscles, joints, and other &#x201c;moving parts&#x201d;) and mechanical engineering&#x2014;often comparing a biological system to a mechanical system. The author&#x2019;s final book is specifically about the design of mechanical wheels and the rotation found in nature. It covers both a brief history of human inventions that have some rotational aspects, natural analogs to these systems, and instructions for building simple demonstration models. This book, like Vogel&#x2019;s previous titles, is written in a conversational style that makes it accessible to laypeople and undergraduates, even though it addresses complex topics. It is appealing both as a popular science title and as an educational reading tool for graduate students, faculty, and other researchers interested in the field of biomechanics.

Considered a progenitor of institutional critique, he spearheaded the creation of artworks imbued with a self-conscious awareness of their dependence on the conditions of their exhibition context.</p><p>In the work <i>Kunsthalle Bern 1992,</i> Asher removed the radiators from all the museum's exhibition spaces and reassembled them in its entryway gallery. Metal pipes connected the relocated radiators to their original sockets; these tubular conduits, coursing in linear fashion along the Kunsthalle's walls, kept the steam heat flowing and endowed the installation with directional lines of force. This &#x201c;displacement of givens&#x201d; offers a perfect example of site-specific practice, one that took the gallery space and the institution itself as its subject.

Poe, short story writer, editor and critic, he is best known for his macabre tales and as the progenitor of the detective story. He died in 1849, in mysterious circumstances, at the age of forty.Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door &#x2014;<br>&nbsp;Only this, and nothing more."<br><p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<br>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>Eagerly I wished the morrow; &#x2014; vainly I had sought to borrow<br>From my books surcease of sorrow &#x2014; sorrow for the lost Lenore &#x2014;<br>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore &#x2014;<br>&nbsp;Nameless here for evermore.<br></p><p>And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>Thrilled me &#x2014; filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,<br>"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door &#x2014;<br>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; &#x2014;<br>&nbsp;This it is, and nothing more."<br></p><p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>That I scarce was sure I heard you"&#x2014; here I opened wide the door; &#x2014;<br>&nbsp;Darkness there, and nothing more.<br></p><p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br>But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?"<br>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!" &#x2014;<br>&nbsp;Merely this, and nothing more.<br></p><p>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br>Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br>"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice:<br>Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore &#x2014;<br>Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; &#x2014;<br>&nbsp;'Tis the wind and nothing more."<br></p><p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;<br>Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br>But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door &#x2014;<br>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door &#x2014;<br>&nbsp;Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br></p><p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.<br>"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,<br>Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore &#x2014;<br>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"<br>&nbsp;Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br></p><p>Much I marveled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>Though its answer little meaning&#x2014; little relevancy bore;<br>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door &#x2014;<br>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br>&nbsp;With such name as "Nevermore."<br></p><p>But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>Nothing further then he uttered&#x2014; not a feather then he fluttered &#x2014;<br>Till I scarcely more than muttered, "other friends have flown before &#x2014;<br>On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."<br>&nbsp;Then the bird said, "Nevermore."<br></p><p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,<br>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore &#x2014;<br>Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br>&nbsp;Of 'Never &#x2014; nevermore'."<br></p><p>But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,<br>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;<br>Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore &#x2014;<br>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore<br>&nbsp;Meant in croaking "Nevermore."<br></p><p>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;<br>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br>On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,<br>But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,<br>&nbsp;She shall press, ah, nevermore!<br></p><p>Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee &#x2014; by these angels he hath sent thee<br>Respite &#x2014; respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore<br>Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"<br>&nbsp;Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br></p><p>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil! &#x2014; prophet still, if bird or devil! &#x2014;<br>Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br>Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted &#x2014;<br>On this home by horror haunted&#x2014; tell me truly, I implore &#x2014;<br>Is there &#x2014; is there balm in Gilead? &#x2014; tell me &#x2014; tell me, I implore!"<br>&nbsp;Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br></p><p>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil &#x2014; prophet still, if bird or devil!<br>By that Heaven that bends above us &#x2014; by that God we both adore -<br>Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br>It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore -<br>Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."<br>&nbsp;Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br></p><p>"Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend," I shrieked, upstarting &#x2014;<br>"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!<br>Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br>Leave my loneliness unbroken!&#x2014; quit the bust above my door!<br>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"<br>&nbsp;Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br></p><p>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br>On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,<br>And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>&nbsp;Shall be lifted &#x2014;

Fay has gone back to primary documents: Shostakovich's many letters, concert programs and reviews, newspaper articles, and diaries of his contemporaries. An indefatigable worker, he wrote his arresting music despite deprivations during the Nazi invasion and constant surveillance under Stalin's regime. <br>Shostakovich's life is a fascinating example of the paradoxes of living as an artist under totalitarian rule. In August 1942, his Seventh Symphony, written as a protest against fascism, was performed in Nazi-besieged Leningrad by the city's surviving musicians, and was triumphantly broadcast to the German troops, who had been bombarded beforehand to silence them. Alone among his artistic peers, he survived successive Stalinist cultural purges and won the Stalin Prize five times, yet in 1948 he was dismissed from his conservatory teaching positions, and many of his works were banned from performance. He prudently censored himself, in one case putting aside a work based on Jewish folk poems. Under later regimes he balanced a career as a model Soviet, holding government positions and acting as an international ambassador with his unflagging artistic ambitions. <br>In the years since his death in 1975, many have embraced a view of Shostakovich as a lifelong dissident who encoded anti-Communist messages in his music. This lucid and fascinating biography demonstrates that the reality was much more complex. Laurel Fay's book includes a detailed list of works, a glossary of names, and an extensive bibliography, making it an indispensable resource for future studies of Shostakovich.<br></p><p><br>Laurel E. Fay is a widely published writer on Russian and Soviet music, who has been traveling to and studying in Russia since 1971. She lives in Staten Island, New York.<br>Fay, an academic specializing in Russian music, notes in her introduction to this careful and detailed study of the Soviet composer's life and work that "there is not a single even remotely reliable resource in Russian, English, or any other language for the basic facts" about him. She has therefore set herself dutifully to sort fact from tendentious politicizing as best she canAwhether from the "right" (a dutiful Soviet official biography) or the "left" (Solomon Volkov's highly suspect Testament, which suggested the composer was a closet rebel against state conformism all his life). Dmitry Shostakovich (1906-1975) was certainly the pre-eminent composer who lived his entire creative life under the Soviet regime (Prokofiev escaped to Paris for an extended period). As such, he became, perforce, a cultural icon, despite his occasional fallings from grace with the Kremlin. One of the virtues of Fay's book is her picture of the endless mundane tasks to which Shostakovich was subjected: rote speeches, statements, interviews, appearances at conferences. In many ways his life was that of a senior civil servant, a role he performed with extraordinary conscientiousness. As a personality, however, he remains profoundly elusive. Fay reports that Shostakovich was frequently witty and sardonic, but gives few glimpses of this side of him. More importantly, it is never explained whether his apparent equivocations about deplorable aspects of Soviet artistic policy sprang from cowardice or cynicism. What is certain was that this enormously prolific, hard-working artist left behind a legacy of powerful, often agonizingly somber, work that is even more striking considering the circumstancesAoften feeble health, worries about money and personal securityAunder which he wrote. Fay has done a notable job of clearing the brush; a more substantial and penetrating portrait remains to be constructed on that cleared site. Illustrations not seen by PW.

These defining events of the Second World War exemplify both the immense heroism and the grievous costs of global conflict. They are the tense, thrilling moments that had the potential to swing the war in favor of either side and in turn change the course of history. In this gripping new look at the twentieth century's most crucial conflict, historian P. M. H. Bell analyzes twelve unique turning points that determined the character and the ultimate outcome of the Second World War.</p><p>Be they military campaigns, economic actions, or diplomatic summits, Bell's twelve turning points span the full breadth of the war, from the home front to the front line. Many are familiar&#x2014;Barbarossa and Hiroshima among them&#x2014;while sections on war production, the Atlantic convoy system, and the conferences at Tehran and Yalta emphasize the importance of the combatants' actions off the battlefield. Through these keenly narrated episodes, Bell reveals how the Allied and Axis powers achieved their greatest successes and stumbled into their strategic failures, inviting us to think about the Second World War in a fresh, stimulating way. Ultimately, his close study of these dozen turning points reminds us, often terrifyingly, how easily things might have turned out differently.</p></p><p><b>P. M. H.

Pigeons captures a Brooklyn man&#x2019;s quest to win the Main Event (the pigeon world&#x2019;s equivalent of the Kentucky Derby), as well as a pigeon shoot where entrants pay $150 to shoot live pigeons. Blechman tracks down Mike Tyson, the nation&#x2019;s most famous pigeon lover, and he sheds light on a radical pro-pigeon underground&#x201d; in New York City. In <i>Pigeons</i> , Blechman tells for the first time the remarkable story behind this seemingly unremarkable bird.</p><p>Many people consider the ubiquitous rock dove, better known as the pigeon, a "rat with wings." But as Blechman demonstrates in his enjoyable and informative book, this much maligned bird has served humans well for thousands of years, carrying messages informing the ancient Egyptians about flood levels along the Nile, bearing news of Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo and saving thousands of soldiers' lives during the two world wars. Today pigeons are found everywhere, from the queen of England's luxurious racing pigeon lofts to the garbage-strewn streets of every large city. Pigeons&#x2014;gregarious, easily domesticated and capable of flying for hours at speeds of more than 100 mph&#x2014;are interesting in their own right, but Blechman writes not so much about the birds themselves as about the people who either love or hate them. These include members of a Newe York City homing pigeon club who dedicate themselves to raising and racing pigeons; Queen Elizabeth's royal pigeon handler; breeders who spend years perfecting champion birds for show; gun enthusiasts who participate in brutal live pigeon shoots. Many of these people are eccentric, and while Blechman's book won't convert pigeon haters to pigeon lovers, it does make for entertaining reading. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.The humble rock dove, <i>Columba livia,</i> is so ubiquitous around human habitations that most people cease to notice them. Domesticated almost as long as the dog, pigeons have been a part of human lives for millennia and yet today have become mere hangers-on in modern society. When they are noticed, they are thought of as feathered rats, and yet there are enthusiastic clubs that race homing pigeons, breed fancy pigeons, and keep coops of birds on their roofs. From the Main Event (the Kentucky Derby of pigeon racing) to the Grand Nationals (think Westminster Kennel Club with pigeons), the author delves into the world of pigeon fanciers and learns from some of its gurus. Along the way, Blechman examines genetics and evolution (Darwin based much of his theory on his own pigeon breeding), history (carrier pigeons saved thousands of lives during the World Wars), natural history (how pigeons "home"), mythology (pigeons as symbols of peace and fertility), and pigeon control (both humane and lethal). Readers will never look at their cities' pigeons the same way again. <i>Nancy Bent</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Gellhorn&#39;s ability to get to the truth of a situation heard makes her writing transcend the short shelf life of most reportage.</p><p>No Bio<br><br>No BioSix decades of modern history are condensed into this collection of essays by veteran novelist and journalist Gellhorn, who set out for Paris in 1930, aged 21, with a suitcase and $75, determined to become a foreign correspondent "within a few weeks." In the succeeding 58 years, she has been witness, for starters, to a lynching in Mississippi and to the fall of Czechoslovakia in the '30s, the plight of Italian war orphans in the '40s, the growth of Israel and the Palestinian "problem" in the '50s and '60s, post-Franco Spain in the '70s and the new Cuba in the '80s. Gellhorn has reported on the McCarthy hearings, the Eichmann trial, the Vietnam peace talks, and, more recently, the nuclear protests by the women of Greenham Common, England, and torture in El Salvador. She is a past master of personal journalism, a partisan of human rights who has always regarded writing as "payment for the chance to look and learn." This anthology, a companion to Gellhorn's The Face of War (Paperbacks Forecasts Feb. 12), is a testament to the upheavals in ordinary lives during peacetime wrought by this century's unsavory, divisive politics; it is also a tribute to the few who, like Gellhorn herself, have stood for justice. Gellhorn's obscurity is singularly unwarranted; she is a wise woman and writer. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>How To Survive And Thrive As A Therapist: Information, Ideas, And Resources For Psychologists In Practice</h2><p>This book is a nuts-and-bolts guide to starting, growing, or improving a psychotherapy practice. 15 appendices make key APA professional standards and guidelines and other resources available for consultation in one source.</p><p></p><h2>The Scientific Life: A Moral History of a Late Modern Vocation</h2><p>Who are scientists? What kind of people are they? What capacities and virtues are thought to stand behind their considerable authority? They are experts&#x2014;indeed, highly respected experts&#x2014;authorized to describe and interpret the natural world and widely trusted to help transform knowledge into power and profit. But are they morally different from other people? <i>The Scientific Life</i> is historian Steven Shapin&#x2019;s story about who scientists are, who we think they are, and why our sensibilities about such things matter. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conventional wisdom has long held that scientists are neither better nor worse than anyone else, that personal virtue does not necessarily accompany technical expertise, and that scientific practice is profoundly impersonal. Shapin, however, here shows how the uncertainties attending scientific research make the virtues of individual researchers intrinsic to scientific work. From the early twentieth-century origins of corporate research laboratories to the high-flying scientific entrepreneurship of the present, Shapin argues that the radical uncertainties of much contemporary science have made personal virtues<i> more</i> central to its practice than ever before, and he also reveals how radically novel aspects of late modern science have unexpectedly deep historical roots. His elegantly conceived history of the scientific career and character ultimately encourages us to reconsider the very nature of the technical and moral worlds in which we now live. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Building on the insights of Shapin&#x2019;s last three influential books, featuring an utterly fascinating cast of characters, and brimming with bold and original claims, <i>The Scientific Life</i> is essential reading for anyone wanting to reflect on late modern American culture and how it has been shaped.</p><p>Steven Shapin is the Franklin L. Ford Professor of the History of Science at Harvard University. He is the author of <i>A Social History of Truth </i>and <i>The Scientific Revolution</i>, and with Simon Schaffer, the coauthor of <i>Leviathan and the Air-Pump</i>. He has also written for the <i>New Yorker</i> and is a frequent contributor to the <i>London Review of Books</i>.<p>&#x201c;In <i>The Scientific Life</i>, Steven Shapin writes masterfully about the evolution of what he calls &#x2018;the world of making the worlds to come.&#x2019; Broadly historic, yet deftly nuanced, Shapin constructs a journey that begins with the lone investigators and solitary altruists of lore, through the mutually disdainful academic purists and Organization Men of the mid-twentieth century, to today&#x2019;s technoscientific movers and shakers, who roam an ambiguous moral cosmos of university classrooms, high-tech boardrooms, research hospitals, and Wall Street. He illuminates at each step along the way how men and women of science, who more than any other vocation present us with flashes of the future, have come to regard their pursuits, their times, and, most intriguingly, themselves. I greatly admire the learnedness and dexterity with which Shapin has pulled this off. A forceful, revealing, vital work.&#x201d;</p> (Barry Werth, author of The Billion-Dollar Molecule)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Shapin&#x2019;s <i>The Scientific Life</i> glitters with deep knowledge of the realities of contemporary science as practiced in academe, industry, and government. Lucidly written, it upsets&nbsp;much conventional thinking about the ways and workings of science. It is a terrific book, a&nbsp;welcome addition to a crowded genre, and adds greatly to Shapin&#x2019;s formidable reputation as a leading historian of science.&#x201d;</p> (Daniel S. Greenberg, author of Science for Sale)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Shapin is at his most insightfully mature in this magisterial book. He leads us through a century long tour of the changing figure of the scientist in a remarkably clear and deeply learned manner. The result adroitly bypasses innumerable sterile debates by showing through scholarship and thoughtfulness the place of the scientists in the &#x2018;way we live now.&#x2019; A tour de force!&#x201d;</p> (Paul Rabinow, author of French DNA)<br><br>&#x201c;In this brilliant book Shapin takes us from celebration and criticism to description and understanding of one of the most important phenomena of the twentieth century&#x2014;the creation of technical novelties. Richly paradoxical and entertaining, <i>The Scientific Life</i> contrasts the evidence-free moralizing of the cultural critics and early sociologists of science with the often insightful analyses of the despised industrial researchers. He shows that when adequately described the worlds of technoscientific research and venture capital are not the soulless, routinized, bureaucratic antithesis of the academic ideal, but ones where the necessary uncertainties of innovation are dealt with using face-time, trust, charisma, and even proverbs, things our narratives mistakenly consign to a pre-modern era. This is a book where the doers get their due and the contemplators their comeuppance; where the quotidian is richer than the transcendent.&#x201d; (David Edgerton, author of The Shock of the Old)<br><br>"Shapin here examines science as a vocation. The practice of science, once a calling from God or, perhaps, a mere amateur's hobby, has come into its own as a profession, particularly following World War II. Shapin's sociological history documents this vocational evolution as he raises the following questions: How does the practice and authority of science relate to the virtues of its practitioners? Is academic science superior to the commercialization of science? How does industry compete for the best minds in science? Can the practice of scientific research be organized, team driven, and accountable to investors? Shapin addresses all these questions without weighing in with his personal opinions on the topic. The result is a thought-provoking challenge to the assumptions of scientific objectivity by science's practitioners and an acknowledgment of just how important the morality of scientists may be in the advancement and authority of knowledge." (<i>Library Journal &nbsp; Best of 2008 Sci-Tech Books</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Scientific Life</i> provokes us to discard worn-out understandings that science outside universities is necessarily aberrant and that the credibility of scientific knowledge no longer depends upon moral judgments about the experts who make reality claims. In that task, the book succeeds masterfully." (Thomas F. Gieryn <i>Science</i>)<br><br>"A stunning antidote to the naive portraits of how science is or should be done." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"Shapin has produced a work of exceptional originality, power and significance. He has also given readers much to chew over in regard to contemporary developments and perennial issues. . . . Shapin tells this story exceedingly well, framing its episodes richly and developing them through vivid depictions of representative figures, texts, incidents and anecdotes." (Barbara Herrnstein Smith <i>London Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"Remarkably rich in detail and revelation. . . . Shapin may not be doing a conventional history of the 'scientific life,' but what he has done is both novel and provocative." (H.

From her small town of Star, Mae and her family pray for the astronauts, she and her cousins build a homemade "rocket ship," and they all watch the historic moment on television. Pinkney's remarkable graphite, ink, and watercolor paintings evoke both the vastness of space and the intimacy of 1960s family life. Writing in the voice of a nine-year-old African-American girl, Aston is lyrical and sometimes evocative, though some of her narrative choices are overworked. The visual format of the free verses, with every line beginning with a capital letter, is distracting and interferes with the text's natural rhythms. The choice of the name Mae for the character who aspires to be an astronaut may be homage paid to Mae Jemison, and even the name of the fictional town seems to exist just for its metaphorical value. That said, this book offers children a close-up view of an experience that seems quaint today, but that was life-changing in 1969.&#x2014;<i>Lisa Egly Lehmuller, St. Patrick's Catholic School, Charlotte, NC</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The first major statement by a Jewish leader on the ethics of globalization, it introduces a new paradigm into the search for co-existence. Sacks argues that we must do more than search for common human values. We must also learn to make space for difference, even and especially at the heart of the monotheistic imagination. The global future will call for something stronger than earlier doctrines of toleration or pluralism. It needs a new understanding that the unity of the Creator is expressed in the diversity of creation.</p><p></p><h2>The Master Letters of Emily Dickinson</h2><p>These three letters, which Emily Dickinson drafted to a man she called "Master," stand near the heart of her mystery. Although there is no evidence the letters were ever posted, they indicate a long relationship, geographically apart, in which correspondence would have been the primary means of communication. Dickinson did not write letters as a fictional genre, and these were surely part of a much larger correspondence yet unknown to us. <br><br>In the week following Dickinson's death on May 15, 1886, Lavinia Dickinson found what she described as a locked box containing seven hundred of her sister's poems. The Master letters may have been among them, for they were clearly not with the correspondence, which Lavinia destroyed upon discovery.<br><br>Of primary importance, the Master letters nevertheless have had an uncertain history of discovery, publication, dating, and transcription.

Delivering explicit phonics instruction via a multisensory approach, <strong>Sing, Spell, Read &amp; Write</strong> reaches every avenue to the brain and addresses every student's learning style. For more than two decades, veteran educator Sue Dickson developed and field-tested this program in her own classroom. Where other reading programs were failing the students who were struggling the most, Mrs. Dickson saw first-hand the amazing results her students achieved when she combined music with multimodal teaching strategies. Using look, listen, point, sing-along, and echo routines along with gross motor and fine motor activities, the program activitely engages the senses and effectively reaches all types of learners. Virtually every child is assured of success. Today, the program has a proven, nationwide track record and the soundness of such an approach is strongly supported by current research on brain function, language acquisition, and reading.</p></p><p></p><h2>Native Memoirs from the War of 1812: Black Hawk and William Apess (Johns Hopkins Books on the War of 1812)</h2><p><p>Native peoples played major roles in the War of 1812 as allies of both the United States and Great Britain, but few wrote about their conflict experiences. Two famously wrote down their stories: Black Hawk, the British-allied chief of the still-independent Sauks from the upper Mississippi, and American soldier William Apess, a Christian convert from the Pequots who lived on a reservation in Connecticut. Carl Benn explores the wartime passages of their autobiographies, in which they detail their decisions to take up arms, their experiences in the fighting, their broader lives within the context of native-newcomer relations, and their views on such critical issues as aboriginal independence. </p><p>Scholars, students, and general readers interested in indigenous and military history in the early American republic will appreciate these important memoirs, along with Benn's helpful introductions and annotations.</p></p><p><p>Rare firsthand accounts from Native Americans who fought in the War of 1812.</p><p><b>Carl Benn</b> is a professor of history at Ryerson University in Toronto.

You can count me among the many people who will find it the best undergraduate text on the subject. -- <i>Vincent Crawford, University of California-San Diego</i><br><br>Dixit and Skeath recognize the possibility of teaching the concepts of game theory at the earliest stages of the undergraduate curriculum; this is very progressive and praiseworthy. Using Games of Strategy, students everywhere--budding military strategists at Annapolis and economic theorists in training at Chicago alike--will be able to enjoy an early introduction to the field. The generous variety of illustrative specific cases has the effect that what is learned can be more easily retained than if there were only the assertion of theoretical concepts without enlightening examples. -- <i>John F. Nash jr., Princeton University, Nobel Laureate, Economic Sciences</i><br><br>Games of Strategy provides a marvelous introduction to game theory. It is full of engaging examples drawn from economics, political science, and other areas. This book would serve very well as the core text for a nontechnical game theory course in political science departments. -- <i>Robert Powell, University of California-Berkeley</i><br><br>I have long thought that an elementary game theory text was a great idea, and I have reviewed a number of book proposals and manuscripts by economists hoping to produce such a book. Games of Strategy is super, both in its initial objectives and in its execution of them. -- <i>Amanda Bayer, Swarthmore College</i><br><br>Thanks very much for allowing me to use the draft version of Games of Strategy, by Avinash Dixit and Susan Skeath. It is a superb book, probably the best text that I have used in my twelve years as a college professor. My sense is that it quickly will become the most widely used nontechnical introduction to game theory.

Parent groups have protested her novels' supposed anti-Christian bias, their profanity, and their references to magic. And, yet, Paterson has won both the National Book Award and the Newbery Medal--twice each. More importantly, her books, with their outcast protagonists, have reached even the most unreachable children, the "invisible" children. <i>The Invisible Child</i> collects 25 years of Paterson's speeches and essays about writing, reading, and life. These pieces are wise, reflective, and lovely. They disparage the preponderance of "empty-caloried" books for kids; more so, they celebrate the many enduring books that change children's lives. Paterson writes about the need for wonder in children's books: "the wonder of nature and human nature ... the wonder in the telling ... the wonder behind and beyond the story." She writes not about "creating a character," but about "getting to know a person." And where other writers blame the demands of children, spouses, and other commitments for their inability to produce, Paterson celebrates external limitations. "The very persons who took away my time and space," she says, "are the ones who have given me something to say." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i>Katherine Patersonis the renowned author of many classic childrens books, including <em>Bridge to Terabithia</em>; <em>The Great Gilly Hopkins</em>; <em>Lyddie</em>; <em>Jacob Have I Loved</em>; <em>Come Sing, Jimmy Jo</em>; and <em>The Master Puppeteer</em>, among many others. Her work has won two Newbery Medals and a Newbery Honor, two National Book Awards, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, and the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award.

The first one is purely algebraic. Its objective is the classification of quadratic forms over the field of rational numbers (Hasse-Minkowski theorem). It is achieved in Chapter IV. The first three chapters contain some preliminaries: quadratic reciprocity law, p-adic fields, Hilbert symbols. Chapter V applies the preceding results to integral quadratic forms of discriminant � I. These forms occur in various questions: modular functions, differential topology, finite groups. The second part (Chapters VI and VII) uses &#34;analytic&#34; methods (holomor� phic functions). Chapter VI gives the proof of the &#34;theorem on arithmetic progressions&#34; due to Dirichlet; this theorem is used at a critical point in the first part (Chapter Ill, no. 2.2). Chapter VII deals with modular forms, and in particular, with theta functions. Some of the quadratic forms of Chapter V reappear here. The two parts correspond to lectures given in 1962 and 1964 to second year students at the Ecole Normale Superieure. A redaction of these lectures in the form of duplicated notes, was made by J.-J. Sansuc (Chapters I-IV) and J.-P. Ramis and G. Ruget (Chapters VI-VII). They were very useful to me; I extend here my gratitude to their authors.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French<p>&#x201c;The book is a showcase of how some results in classical number theory (the Arithmetic of the title) can be derived quickly using abstract algebra. ... There are a reasonable number of worked examples, and they are very well-chosen. ... this book will expand your horizons, but you should already have a good knowledge of algebra and of classical number theory before you begin.&#x201d; (Allen Stenger, MAA Reviews, maa.org, July, 2016)</p></p><h2>Reader&#39;s Companion to F. Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s Tender Is the Night</h2><p>Tender is the Night, the novel F. Scott Fitzgerald worked longest and hardest on, has not achieved its proper recognition because the text is peppered with errors and chronological inconsistencies. Moreover, the novel has a concentration of references to people, places and events that most readers no longer recognize. In this guide to the novel, Matthew J. Bruccoli corrects those errors and explains the factual details. He also offers maps, photos, correspondence and notes that demystify the writing of one of literature&#39;s most misunderstood - and underrated - masterpieces.</p><p>Matthew J. Bruccoli is the Emily Brown Jefferies Professor of English at the University of South Carolina.As Bruccoli points out in his introduction, this is not a critical study: it does not analyze the putative meanings of Tender Is the Night. Instead, Bruccoli aims to explore briefly the novel's genesis, creation, publication, and aftermath. The main course of this feast, however, is a lengthy section of explanatory notes on Tender's numerous references. The text is additionally buttressed with photos and illustrations as well as a time scheme and chronology of events. Bruccoli's presentation is thorough without being pedantic, making this quite readable by scholars and students alike. One only hopes that someday this material will be shuffled with Fitzgerald's novel for a long-overdue annotated edition of this greatly underrated work. Academic libraries supporting American literature curricula cannot afford to be without this book.

Bennett</b> is the author of <i>The De-Valuing of America,</i> the coauthor of <i>Body Count,</i> and the editor of <i>The Book of Virtues</i> and <i>The Children's Book of Virtues.</i> He served as Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President Bush and as Secretary of Education and Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities under President Reagan.

He, his wife, Elayne, and their two sons, John and Joseph, live in Chevy Chase, Maryland.All children need bread and shelter. But a true home, of course, is much more than that. Children also need love and order and, because they are not born knowing the difference between right and wrong, a place where they can begin to develop a moral sense. The transmission of virtues is one important reason for a home, and attention to the virtues is one of the important ties that bind a family together. "It is the peculiarity of man, in comparison with the rest of the animal world," Aristotle wrote, "that he alone possesses a perception of good and evil, of the just and the unjust, and of other similar qualities; and it is association in these things which makes a family."<p>And so home is the place where we receive our first instruction in the virtues. It is our first moral training ground, the place where we can come to know right from wrong through the nurturing and protective care of those who love us more than anyone else. Our character takes shape under the guidance of the <i>do</i>s and <i>don't</i>s, the instructions, the exhortations we encounter around the house. Equally important, our moral sense emerges under the influence of examples set by mother, father, sisters, and brothers. In the familiar world of home and hearth, we learn the habits of virtue that will fortify us when we venture into the world.</p><p>In this chapter we find some of these lessons of home and hearth. We find family members helping each other along, and looking toward each other for help. We find siblings showing what "brotherhood" and "sisterhood" really mean. We see children learning about chores and responsibilities and self-sacrifice, and learning to help parents out of love. We encounter young hearts giving loving obedience. We witness the growth of conscience, of a desire to live up to the expectations of those who love us. We witness how our loyalty and courage and perseverance see families through hard times with a love that can overcome any number of obstacles.</p><p>Of course, no home is perfect. Home can be the place where we get our first look at vices as well as virtues. And, unfortunately, some homes are simply not good places -- not all homes are havens; not all hearths have a warm glow. But <i>all</i> homes teach lessons, even if they are the wrong kind of lessons. And so even though many homes do not resemble the best ones we find in these pages, the stories here are no less valuable because they give us all something at which to aim. They remind us of the kind of conditions families need and the attention children deserve. We set these examples before our eyes in order to keep raising our sights and our efforts.</p><p>These first lessons stay with us long after we leave home. In our affections and our memories, they remain forever a part of us, often the most cherished part of us. "Where shall a man find sweetness to surpass his own home and parents?" Odysseus asks in Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>. "In far lands he shall not, though he find a house of gold." The early experiences of home become a moral compass point, guiding and instructing us for the rest of life's journey.</p><p>And in one sense, the moral journey that begins with leaving home is the search for opportunities to offer others the same nurture and love we received in our own childhood. The memory of home becomes a past, an experience, an ideal we seek to re-create in our later lives, and in the new lives we shepherd into the world. We build our own homes, offer our own lessons, nurture our own children in the strength and knowledge once gained beside the first warm hearth of home.<b></b></p><p><b>HUSH, LITTLE BABY</b></p><p>The first notes we hear are those cradle songs that spring from a parent's heart.

Kerr</i></p><p>Home is the place where first lessons are learned. And it is the place where much of what you do, you do for love.</p><p>There was once a boy named Bradley. When he was about eight years old, he fell into the habit of thinking of everything in terms of money. He wanted to know the price of everything he saw, and if it didn't cost a great deal, it did not seem to him to be worth anything at all.</p><p>But there are a great many things money cannot buy. And some of them are the best things in the world.</p><p>One morning when Bradley came down to breakfast, he put a little piece of paper, neatly folded, on his mother's plate. His mother opened it, and she could hardly believe it, but this is what her son had written:</p><blockquote>Mother owes Bradley:<br>For running errands 3 dollars<br>For taking out the trash 2 dollars<br>For sweeping the floor 2 dollars<br>Extras 1 dollar<br>Total that Mother owes Bradley 8 dollars</blockquote><p>His mother smiled when she read that, but she did not say anything.</p><p>When lunchtime came she put the bill on Bradley's plate along with eight dollars. Bradley's eyes lit up when he saw the money. He stuffed it into his pocket as fast as he could and started dreaming about what he would buy with his reward.</p><p>All at once he saw there was another piece of paper besides his plate, neatly folded, just like the first one. When he opened it up, he found it was a bill from his mother. It read:</p><blockquote>Bradley owes Mother:<br>For being good to him nothing<br>For nursing him through his chicken pox nothing<br>For shirts and shoes and toys nothing<br>For his meals and beautiful room nothing<br>Total that Bradley owes Mother nothing</blockquote><p>Bradley sat looking at this new bill, without saying a word. After a few minutes he got up, pulled the eight dollars out of his pocket, and placed them in his mother's hand.</p><p>And after that, he helped his mother for love.</p><p><b>NAILS IN THE POST</b><br><i>M. F. Cowdery</i></p><p>In this tough story from a Civil War-era school reader, we find another kind of lesson that some homes offer. Here is a father giving his son stern but loving moral instruction.</p><p>There was once a farmer who had a son named John, a boy very apt to be thoughtless, and careless about doing what he was told to do.</p><p>One day his father said to him, "John, you are so careless and forgetful, that every time you do wrong, I shall drive a nail into this post, to remind you how often you are naughty. And every time you do right I will draw one out." His father did as he said he would, and every day he had one and sometimes a great many nails to drive in, but very seldom one to draw out.</p><p>At last John saw that the post was quite covered with nails, and he began to be ashamed of having so many faults. He resolved to be a better boy, and the next day he was so good and industrious that several nails came out. The day after it was the same thing, and so on for a long time, till at length only one nail remained. His father then called him, and said: "Look, John, here is the very last nail, and now I'm going to draw it out. Are you not glad?"</p><p>John looked at the post, and then, instead of expressing his joy, as his father expected, he burst into tears. "Why," said the father, "what's the matter? I should think you would be delighted; the nails are all gone."</p><p>"Yes," sobbed John, "the <i>nails</i> are gone, but the <i>scars</i> are there yet."</p><p>So it is, dear children, with your faults and bad habits; you may overcome them, you may by degrees cure them, but the scars remain. Now, take my advice, and whenever you find yourselves doing a wrong thing, or getting into a bad habit, stop at once. For every time you give in to it, you drive another nail, and that will leave a <i>scar</i> on your soul, even if the nail should be afterwards drawn out.</p><p><b>NORTHWEST PASSAGE</b><br><i>Robert Louis Stevenson</i></p><p>There is no better place to begin learning about bravery than in the safe confines of home.

W. Rolleston masterfully retells the great Celtic myths and illuminates the world that spawned them. Focusing principally on Irish myths, the book first takes up the history and religion of the Celts, the myths of the Irish invasion and the early Milesian kings.<br>What follows is pure enchantment as you enter the timeless world of heroic tales centered around the Ulster king Conor mac Nessa and the Red Branch Order of chivalry (Ultonian cycle). These are followed by the tales of the Ossianic cycle, which center on the figure of Finn mac Cumhal, whose son Ois�n (or Ossian) was a poet and warrior, and the traditional author of most of the tales. Next comes a summary of the Voyage of Maeld&#x16b;n, a brilliant and curious piece of invention that exemplifies the genre of "wonder-voyages" &#x2014; adventures purely in the region of romance, out of earthly space and time. Finally, the author recounts a selection of the myths and tales of the Cymry (Welsh).<br>In these pages, readers will delight in the favorite and familiar tales of Cuchulain, King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, the Grail, Deirdre, and many more figures that haunt the shadowy, twilight world of Celtic legend. The magic of that world is further brought to life in more than 50 imaginative full-page illustrations by Stephen Reid, Arthur G. Bell, and the famed illustrator J. C. Leyendecker. Reprinted here in its first paperback edition, Celtic Myths and Legends also includes several helpful genealogical tables: Gods of the House of D&#x14d;n, Gods of the House of Llyr, and Arthur and His Kin, as well as a useful glossary.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Married Love (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>The book that was to become <em>Married Love</em> grew from Marie Stopes's conviction that the state of modern middle-class marriage was, like her own, desperate, and that the cause of this desperation was sexual unhappiness. She knew that her book would "probably electrify the country" of England. Indeed, it remains one of the best-known sex manuals ever written. This is the only available edition of Marie Stopes's pioneering sex manual--one of the first books to discuss sex frankly and to describe how to achieve pleasure for both sexes during intercourse. The manual combines a lyrical evocation of marital love with a no-nonsense and detailed account of sexual intercourse and sexual pleasure that was a sensation when it was published in 1918. Stopes advocated equality in marriage and the importance of women's sexuality and sexual desire. She also took the controversial step of openly supporting birth control.<br> <br> In this edition of Stopes's ground-breaking work, Ross McKibbin's introduction reveals fascinating insights into Stopes and the prevailing attitudes towards class, religion, science, and above all, sex. Stopes's own experience in marriage is inextricably linked with <em>Married Love</em> and her often controversial views are fully discussed.</p><p><br><strong>Ross R.

Written in a conversational tone and includes many easy-to-identify-with examples. There are many engaging vignettes which illustrate how couples (even therapists!) can learn to deal with relationship problems, using nonaccusative means of communication. Addresses problems that affect some married couples such as lack of affection, criticism, dependency, fear of commitment, or selfishness, which can lead to arguments, discouragement, or a stalemate. Provides new thoughts on the dangers of too much compromise, and how to manage inevitable conflict. Also suitable for communications studies. Written by the author of <i>Couples Therapy: A Nontraditional Approach</i>.</p><p>Twenty years as a practicing psychologist has shown the author the bonanza of difficulties that can beset couplesfrom the nitpicking annoyances to divorce-sized concernsand many readers will recognize certain elements of discord discussed here. By illustrating, with examples, how small behavioral details can mask major issues between partners, and by creating mock conversations between couples, Wile pinpoints the habits and thought patterns he believes frequently threaten relationships. His ideas are not new and his main message is familiar: at the bottom of most troubles lies a lack of communication. He maintains that partners fall into accusatory modes of thinking that block attempts at harmony, and he suggests some insightful strategies for "blending" problems into a relationship. What most invigorates this book, though, is Wile's firm grasp and display of sensitive psychological points between partnersthe fear of abandonment and of being taken for granted, the resentment of domination, dependency and boredomthat, in fact, are the roots of many conflicts. Those willing to wade through the recurrent pattern of theory and example that guides Wile's writing will find a commonsensical approach to relationships and a healthy pep talk that may get them started toward better times.

Vann Woodward and Chesnut's biographer Elisabeth Muhlenfeld present here the previously unpublished Civil War diaries of Mary Boykin Chesnut. The ideal diarist, Mary Chesnut was at the right place at the right time with the right connections. Daughter of one senator from South Carolina and wife of another, she had kin and friends all over the Confederacy and knew intimately its political and military leaders. At Montgomery when the new nation was founded, at Charleston when the war started, and at Richmond during many crises, she traveled extensively during the war. She watched a world "literally kicked to pieces" and left the most vivid account we have of the death throes of a society. The diaries, filled with personal revelations and indiscretions, are indispensable to an appreciation of our most famous Southern literary insight into the Civil War experience.<br></p><p>C.

Why? Because every day, farmers and gardeners help plants and animals begin life <em>and</em> help plants and animals end life. They are intimately attuned to the food chain. They understand how all living things are seated around a dining table, eating while being eaten. They realize that all of nature is in flux.</p> <p><em>Gene Everlasting</em> contains Logsdon&#x2019;s reflections, by turns both humorous and heart-wrenching, on nature, death, and eternity, all from a contrary farmer&#x2019;s perspective. He recounts joys and tragedies from his childhood in the 1930s and &#x2018;40s spent on an Ohio farm, through adulthood and child-raising, all the way up to his recent bout with cancer, always with an eye toward the lessons that farming has taught him about life and its mysteries.</p> <p>Whether his subject is parsnips, pigweed, immortality, irises, green burial, buzzards, or compound interest, Logsdon generously applies as much heart and wit to his words as he does care and expertise to his fields.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Over the course of his long life and career as a writer, farmer, and journalist, Gene Logsdon published more than two dozen books, both practical and philosophical, on all aspects of rural life and affairs. His nonfiction works include&nbsp;<em>Gene Everlasting, A Sanctuary of Trees,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Living at Nature&#x2019;s Pace.&nbsp;</em>He wrote a popular blog,&nbsp;<em>The Contrary Farmer,</em>&nbsp;as well as an award-winning column for the Carey, Ohio,&nbsp;<em>Progressor Times</em>. Gene was also a contributor to&nbsp;<em>Farming Magazine</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Draft Horse Journal.&nbsp;</em>He lived and farmed in Upper Sandusky, Ohio, where he died in 2016, a few weeks after finishing&nbsp;his final&nbsp;book,&nbsp;<em>Letter to a Young Farmer</em>.</p><p><strong><em>Booklist-</em></strong></p> <p>"In a prolific career stretching back to the early 1970s, Logsdon has penned hundreds of farm and garden articles, four novels, and nearly two dozen nonfiction books on topics ranging from cutting wood to managing manure. Now entering his ninth decade, Logsdon turns his attention here to his own, and everyone else&#x2019;s, unavoidable demise. In 21 contemplative and often trenchantly witty essays, the author ruminates over a wide variety of religious and materialistic ideas about death and finds the greatest comfort in the notion that, when his body returns to the soil, it will provide sustenance for new life. Logsdon praises the contemporary trend toward burials in biodegradable caskets and takes a jaundiced view of beliefs in a blissful, never-ending afterlife. Related pieces review his mother&#x2019;s last week of life, the reasons people commit suicide, and an &#x201c;immortal&#x201d; herbicide-resistant weed. While his legion of fans may pale at the thought that Logsdon has just written his swan song, his recent remission from cancer offers hope that his writing days are far from over.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Shelf Awareness</em>, Starred Review-</strong></p> <p>"As anyone who has lived on a farm can attest, one is closer to life and death when dealing with nature and animals on a daily basis. The poetic prose of Gene Logsdon's&nbsp;<em>Gene Everlasting</em>, a reflection on life as an Ohio farmer, brings readers into that close connection of beginnings and endings, the inner, always-turning circle of chores, natural discoveries and seasonal work.</p> <p>Logsdon (<em>A Sanctuary of Trees</em>) blends careful observations of the natural world with sometimes humorous, often melancholic contemplations that gently lead the reader to ponder such topics as the death of a beloved pet, the mysterious nature of cemeteries, the number of suicides in any given year, butchering hogs, buzzards in the backyard and the sudden uptick in backyard farms and gardens. He expertly intertwines these seemingly disconnected subjects with the cyclic qualities of nature and the overall sense that life and death are forever paired&#x2015;that one cannot and should not exist without the other, thereby removing the fear of death.</p> <p>Logsdon also eloquently reveals early childhood memories and his fears of the meaning of everlasting hell, his acceptance of his mother's untimely death and his own need to confront death when diagnosed with cancer. The culminating effect is not morbid, but philosophical and absorbing, like a musical fugue that builds and recedes, gracefully moving toward an acceptance and understanding of what living and dying truly mean.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Publishers Weekly-</em></strong></p> <p>"Dryly humorous, intelligently original, and at times poetic, Logsdon (<em>A Sanctuary of Trees</em>) muses and wisecracks about cycles of life and death, nature&#x2019;s resilience, and humanity&#x2019;s follies from the rolling hills and changing seasons of his farm in Sandusky, Ohio, just steps from where he grew up, as he finds himself still alive after a bout with cancer. The themes of these short essays vary widely: the hypocrisy of money-lending and compound interest; the need for 'secret crying places'; the breathtaking but 'awesomely eerie' wonder of buzzards: 'nothing symbolizes better the reality of farm and garden, bustling with life but always near to death,' he writes. Logsdon seems to have taken to heart the lessons he&#x2019;s gleaned from parsnips: 'cultivate an independent kind of ornery reliability..., develop a distinctive personality... appreciated by the few rather than the many..., don&#x2019;t try to look too pretty... you&#x2019;ll be asked to head up a fund-raiser.' Great bedtime reading, these succinct, thought-provoking, life-affirming essays are a perfect gift for your favorite gardener, nature lover, philosopher, or curmudgeon."</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Kirkus Reviews-</em></strong></p> <p>STARRED REVIEW: "A self-proclaimed contrarian and octogenarian cancer survivor finds renewal in the prospect of death while raising issues that challenge&nbsp;science and religion alike.&nbsp;Though Logsdon (<em>A Sanctuary of Trees</em>, 2012) loves nature as much as the next writer and more than most, he refuses to indulge in the&nbsp;usual sentimentality and poetics of nature writing in this series of interconnected essays that combine plainspoken prose, cleareyed&nbsp;observation and provocative thought. There is plenty here to annoy environmental alarmists, Christians, Republicans, agribusiness,&nbsp;vegetarians (or anyone else bothered by the detailed, don&#x2019;t-read-before-dinner description of killing and butchering) and others who&nbsp;subscribe to various forms of conventional wisdom. 'I write this book believing that the human race, including myself, is irrational,' he says. 'But being irrational is not all bad....Nevertheless, totally contradicting everything I have written above (another mark of human&nbsp;insanity), I really do intend this book to be a comfort and a solace for those people facing death. And that means all of us.' The author&nbsp;maintains that despite 'much hand-wringing over diseases that are attacking oak trees...as long as climate dictates trees, trees in one form&nbsp;or another will be here.' The perceptual problem, says the writer who once studied to be a priest, is that 'the human mind sees cycles&nbsp;because we think in terms of beginnings and endings, of causes and effects, of time passing. But the forest acts only in the everlasting&nbsp;NOW.' And that 'everlasting NOW' provides perspective and comfort throughout these meditations on mortality and renewal, particularly&nbsp;after the author&#x2019;s cancer diagnosis. He experienced an epiphany during the final spring he thought he might not experience: 'I wanted May to&nbsp;last forever. But now I understood that it was only because nature changed every month, every day, every moment, that it could come again.&nbsp;Only through change is permanence achieved....To understand immortality, embrace mortality.' Wisdom and experience permeate this perceptive and understatedly well-written meditation."</p></p><h2>Carnal Alchemy: Sado-Magical Techniques for Pleasure, Pain, and Self-Transformation</h2><p>BDSM sexuality as a powerful tool for self-transformation and the realization of magical and spiritual aims <br> <br>� Details how to combine the 6 major types of S&amp;M stimulation with sexual stimulation for magical and transformative purposes <br> <br>� Explores sado-magical workings from both submissive and dominant perspectives <br> <br>� Traces the roots of the BDSM tradition from ancient pagan and shamanic rituals to historical figures such as the Marquis de Sade, Aleister Crowley, and Anton LaVey <br> <br>Sex magic allows us to tap in to the most abundant power source available: sexual energy. Magicians, shamans, and fakirs throughout history have used physical stimulation and ritual to harness sexual energy, unlock inner states of consciousness, and activate the ability to influence their surroundings. While pleasure is often the focus of this stimulation, pain is just as effective, if not more so. <br> <br>Combining both pleasure and pain, the sadomasochistic practice of Carnal Alchemy offers a powerful tool for self-transformation and the realization of magical and spiritual aims. Authors Stephen and Crystal Dawn Flowers explain the sado-magical workings of Carnal Alchemy from both the perspective of the submissive partner as well as the dominant. They detail the 6 major techniques of sadomasochistic stimulation--bondage, flagellation, piercing, penetration, clamping, and heat/cold--and how they can be combined with sexual stimulation for magical purposes. They trace the roots of the BDSM tradition in ancient pagan rites of passage, in indigenous shamanic rituals, and through historical figures who used this form of sexuality in their magic and philosophy, from the Marquis de Sade to more modern exemplars such as Aleister Crowley, Ernst Schertel, and Anton LaVey. <br> <br>This guide also covers specialized furniture and tools and the decor of &#x201c;the Chamber&#x201d; to trigger states of consciousness in which the Sado-Magician can effectively express his or her will.</p><p>Stephen E.

How and why do party alignments change? Are the party-centered elections of the past better for democratic politics than the candidate-centered elections of the present? In this landmark book, John Aldrich goes beyond the clamor of arguments over whether American political parties are in resurgence or decline and undertakes a wholesale reexamination of the foundations of the American party system.<br><br>Surveying three critical episodes in the development of American political parties&#x2014;from their formation in the 1790s to the Civil War&#x2014;Aldrich shows how parties serve to combat three fundamental problems of democracy: how to regulate the number of people seeking public office; how to mobilize voters; and how to achieve and maintain the majorities needed to accomplish goals once in office. Overcoming these obstacles, argues Aldrich, is possible only with political parties.<br><br>Aldrich brings this innovative account up to date by looking at the profound changes in the character of political parties since World War II. In the 1960s, he shows, parties started to become candidate-centered organizations that are servants to their office seekers and officeholders. Aldrich argues that this development has revitalized parties, making them stronger, and more vital, with well-defined cleavages and highly effective governing ability.</p><p><p><strong>John H. Aldrich </strong>is the Pfizer-Pratt University Professor of Political Science at Duke University. He is the author or coauthor of numerous books and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>" Doing something" about U.S. political parties--making them stronger or weaker, adding a third party, replacing the Democrats and Republicans with new, more cohesive alignments--is a central recommendation of dozens of recent books and articles. Readers interested enough in this subject to plow through academic political science's statistical and linguistic impediments will find complex, nuanced history and thoughtful analysis here. Aldrich views any major political party as inevitably "the creature of the politicians, the ambitious office seeker and officeholder." To achieve their own goals, ambitious politicians participate in and shape specific institutional arrangements (in this case, political parties) within the historical context of their own times. Where other theorists see the past 30 years as "the decline (dealignment, decay, even decomposition) of parties," Aldrich takes a somewhat different tack. "Events in the 1960s," he maintains, represent "the final demise of the form of parties created by Van Buren," giving ambitious politicians a good deal of independence. As a result, the parties that once <i>controlled</i> ambitious office seekers are now defined by their need to <i>serve</i> them. <i>Mary Carroll</i></p><h2>Teaching Students with Language and Communication Disabilities (4th Edition) (The Allyn &amp; Bacon Communication Sciences and Disorders)</h2><p><p>Emphasizing&nbsp; the connection between language and literacy, the fourth edition of <i>Teaching Students with Language and Communication Disabilities</i> explores language development and&nbsp; language disorders within the context of specific disabilities.</p> <p> <b> <i>&nbsp;</i> </b> </p> <p>Organized in a three-part format, the text examines language development and disorders in school-age children,&nbsp; analyzes language difficulties associated with specific disabilities, and presents assessment techniques and instructional strategies used in today's classrooms.

Happily, Uncle Dynamite is another winner. First published in 1948, it is one of the few books about Uncle Fred (a.k.a.

Of course, with Uncle Fred spreading sweetness and light, generous helpings of happy endings can be counted on.

When the chemicals diffusing in the primordial waters came together to form the first living cell, that was emergence. When the activities of the neurons in the brain result in mind, that too is emergence.<br> In <em>The Emergence of Everything</em>, one of the leading scientists involved in the study of complexity, Harold J. Morowitz, takes us on a sweeping tour of the universe, a tour with 28 stops, each one highlighting a particularly important moment of emergence. For instance, Morowitz illuminates the emergence of the stars, the birth of the elements and of the periodic table, and the appearance of solar systems and planets. We look at the emergence of living cells, animals, vertebrates, reptiles, and mammals, leading to the great apes and the appearance of humanity. He also examines tool making, the evolution of language, the invention of agriculture and technology, and the birth of cities. And as he offers these insights into the evolutionary unfolding of our universe, our solar system, and life itself, Morowitz also seeks out the nature of God in the emergent universe, the God posited by Spinoza, Bruno, and Einstein, a God Morowitz argues we can know through a study of the laws of nature. <br> Written by one of our wisest scientists, <em>The Emergence of Everything</em> offers a fascinating new way to look at the universe and the natural world, and it makes an important contribution to the dialogue between science and religion.</p><p><br><strong>Harold J.

A leading figure in the study of complexity, he was Editor-in-Chief of the journal <em>Complexity</em> and is co-chair of the science board of the Santa Fe Institute. His writing has appeared in <em>The New York Times, Discover, The Washington Post, The Sciences</em>, and <em>Psychology Today</em>.<br><br>"Closely reasoned and rich in scientific and philosophical background."--<em>Scientifc American</em><p></p><br>"For more than two decades Harold Morowitz has been honored as a creative and persuasive leader in origin-of-life research. Now, with <em>The Emergence of Everything</em>, he expands his horizon in a stunningly original and provocative book. With encyclopedic knowledge, gentle humor, lucid style and sweeping vision, Morowitz tackles the grandest questions at the interface of science and religion, and he makes a compelling case for the inexorable rise in universal complexity, from the Big Bang to galaxies to life, and perhaps beyond."--Dr. Robert Hazen, Geophysical Laboratory, Carnegie Institution of Washington<p></p><br>"Harold Morowitz has the rare ability to provide a general audience with both the excitement and the insights of science, without stinting either facts or theory. In <em>The Emergence of Everything</em>, Morowitz manages a tour de force, building a ladder of 28 rungs climbing from the beginnings of the universe to the advent of consciousness. At each level, he shows how the phenomena of that level emerge from building blocks provided by the previous level. This emergence, the mysterious phenomenon wherein the whole is more than the sum of its parts, is a central concept in studies of complex systems, which Stephen Hawking calls 'the science of the 21st century.' Morowitz's ladder is a worthy climb--there is no better book for developing a detailed understanding of emergence."--John Holland, author of <em>Emergence: From Chaos to Order</em><p></p><br>"This is a brilliant book. Morowitz has provided the first state-of-the-art overview of the theory of emergence across the scientific disciplines. Neither too detailed nor too abstract, his 28 stages of emergence trace the history of the universe from the Big Bang through the appearance of culture, philosophy and spirituality. No other work has laid out the core case for emergence--and hence against the ultimacy of reductionism--across the whole spectrum of science. This introduction to emergence theory should guide philosophers of science and anthropologists, theologians and metaphysicians, as they reflect on the nature of Homo sapiens and our place in the cosmos." --Philip Clayton, Visiting Professor, Harvard University<p></p><br></p><h2>Loose Leaf for Personal Finance</h2><p>The journey to financial freedom starts here!

Our identities give us our sense of how we are supposed to act and how we may or must treat others, so how we hold each other in our identities is of crucial moral importance. To hold someone in her identity is to treat her according to the stories one uses to make sense of who she is. Done well, holding allows individuals to flourish personally and in their interactions with others; done poorly, it diminishes their self-respect and restricts their participation in social life. If the identity is to represent accurately the person who bears it, the tissue of stories that constitute it must continue to change as the person grows and changes. Here, good holding is a matter of retaining the stories that still depict the person but letting go of the ones that no longer do. The book begins with a puzzling instance of personhood, where the work of holding someone in her identity is tragically one-sided. It then traces this work of holding and letting go over the human life span, paying special attention to its implications for bioethics. A pregnant woman starts to call her fetus into personhood. Children develop their moral agency as they learn to hold themselves and others in their identities. Ordinary adults hold and let go, sometimes well and sometimes badly. People bearing damaged or liminal identities leave others uncertain how to hold and what to let go. Identities are called into question at the end of life, and persist after the person has died. In all, the book offers a glimpse into a fascinating moral terrain that is ripe for philosophical exploration.<br></p><p><br><strong>Hilde Lindemann</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at Michigan State University. A Fellow of the Hastings Center and a past president of the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities, she is also a former editor of Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy, and the <em>Hastings Center Report</em>. She has written widely on narrative approaches to bioethics, feminist ethics, the ethics of families, and the social construction of persons and their identities.<br><br>"<em>Holding and Letting Go</em> is deceptively easy to read. The prose is so delightful and the observations so incisive that it is difficult to put it down. But a great deal of hard philosophical work is being done in these pages, and there is intricate engagement with a wide range of important contemporary positions. What emerges is a rich, new structure for thinking about the nature of identity and its relation to the kinds of ethical dilemmas and difficulties we face every day. We are shown not just a compelling and thought-provoking set of views about these issues, but a new way of thinking about them, one that promises to shed some light where things have been notoriously opaque... <em>Holding and Letting Go</em> is a sophisticated, tender-hearted, and clear-eyed view of persons that provides original and compelling insights into what we are and why it matters. We will be engaging with it for a long time to come." --<em>Hypatia</em> <br><p></p><br>"In this book Hilde Lindemann shows us that good philosophy needs good writing, but also that good writing can contribute to good philosophy... it is how moral philosophy should be done." --<em>Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</em><p></p><br>"In this wonderfully wise book Hilde Lindemann weaves stories into theory to help us see how we weave stories into lives, and how through these stories we hold each other in personhood-for good and for ill. Her stories put flesh on the dry bones of much-discussed, overly-abstracted philosophical problems; and in so doing she makes a case for philosophical theorizing as an embodied, engaged, emotionally and socially responsive practice."--Naomi Scheman, University of Minnesota<p></p><br>"With her characteristic lucid and engaging prose, Hilde Lindemann combines philosophical depth with richness of concrete detail in her new book -- a book that significantly extends and deepens the narrative approach to bioethics that she founded in her <em>Damaged Identities; Narrative Repair</em>. In <em>Holding and Letting Go</em>, she compellingly demonstrates how identity and personhood are substantial achievements that often depend upon the help and participation of others. This important book shows the complexity of issues concerning personal identity, intimacy, and embodiment, and their centrality to key debates in the ethics of health care throughout the life cycle."--Rebecca Kukla, Georgetown University<p></p><br>"Lindemann writes with great sensitivity to the complexities of everyday identity work, and, one suspects, with no more and no less precision than the practice of personhood allows." <br>-- <em>The Philosophers' Magazine</em><p></p><br>"Lindemann manages to pull off that rarest of rare feats in academic philosophical writing: to say something that is at the same time philosophically insightful and universally relevant for beings like ourselves..." -- <em>Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"A valuable addition to the literature on personhood and identity. Like most such texts, it recognizes the ambiguity of the concepts. However, while other texts then try to clarify and fix the ambiguity, Lindemann goes in another direction. She embraces it by presenting and examining the many ways in which practices of social connection, interaction, and disconnection shape, preserve, and even damage an individual's personal and social identityELIn an age where the daily news contains stories of murder, rape, and persecution of humans by humans for reasons related to an inability or unwillingness to tolerate others for who they are, Lindemann provides no platitudes. Rather, she calls attention to the real, rollup-your-sleeves phroenetic work of personhood that can only be approached in steps and measured by effort. Her book resonates long after the last page is turned." --<em>International Journal of Feminist Approaches to Bioethics</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Cultures of Solidarity: Consciousness, Action, and Contemporary American Workers</h2><p>A commonplace assumption about American workers is that they lack class consciousness.

The book brings together some 75 short pieces about principles and techniques for requirements analysis, specification and design.<br> <br>The ideas discussed are deep, but at the same time lightly and wittily expressed. The book is fun to read, rewarding the reader with many valuble and novel insights. Some sacred cows, including top-down development, dataflow diagrams and the distinction between What and How, are led to the slaughter. Readers will be provoked--perhaps to fury, perhaps to enthusiasm, but surely to think more deeply about topics and issues of central importance in the field of software development.<br> <br>There are new ideas about problem structuring, based on the concept of a problem frame, leading to a clearer notion of complexity and how to deal with it. And other important topics include:<br> </p><ul> <li>Principles for evaluating development methods </li> <li>New approaches to capturing and describing requirements and specifications, based on the relationship between the software system and the problem context </li> <li>The technology of desciption in software, including new ideas such as designations, the separation of descriptive moods and the scope and span of description </li> <li>Incisive information about the proper role of mathematics and formalism. </li> </ul> <br>&nbsp;<p></p></p><p><p>The practice of the book's title is the practice of software development, especially of the requirement and specification activities that often precede programming. The principles are those that I believe should govern software development and the methods by which we try to make it easier and more effective. And the prejudices are the settled personal opinions that I have formed over some years of thinking about these things.</p><p>The central theme of the book is the relationship of method to problem structure on one side and to description on the other. To deal with a significant problem you have to analyse and structure it. That means analysing and structuring the problem itself, not the system that will solve it. Too often we push the problem into the background because we are in a hurry to proceed to a solution. If you read most software development texts thoughtfully, you will see that almost everything in them is about the solution; almost nothing is about the problem.</p><p>On the other side, description is important because it is the clay in which software developers fashion their works. Methods are, above all, about what to describe; about tools and materials and techniques for descriptions; and about imposing a coherent structure on a large description task.</p><p>This book does not explain or advocate one particular development method. Nor is it a survey of methods, or an encyclopaedia of techniques and notations. It explains what I hope and believe are useful ideas and insights--both my own and other people's. It is arranged as an alphabetically ordered set of short pieces forming a lexicon, or a kind of specialized dictionary. Because many of the ideas are neglected or simply unfamiliar, the selection of topics, the content and some of the terminology are unconventional. This is not in any way meant to be a standard reference work.</p><p>I chose the dictionary form for two reasons. First, because a more structured arrangement would have seemed to promise a unity and a completeness that I cannot attain. This is a collection of ideas and insights, not a new method. Second, putting the same point more positively, because I believe that many of the ideas in the book can be applied piecemeal in many different development contexts. They can be used to make local improvements in established methods, and to shed light on some of the local difficulties and problems that are met in any development.</p><p>Software development should be a thoughtful activity. You should think not only about the problem and its solution, but also about the way you're tackling it. Some software developers and method users behave as if they were bicycle riders. When you are riding a bike you shouldn't think about what you're doing. If you do think about it you'll probably fall off. But software development isn't like bike riding. You'll be a much better developer if you think consciously about what you're doing, and why. This book is intended to help you.</p><p>When you encounter a difficulty in software development, what you need above all is a set of appropriate conceptual tools. Perhaps you're trying to describe something that stubbornly refuses to fit cleanly into your description; or to disentangle the simple problems that you feel sure must lie beneath the intractable complex problem that is holding you up. The right conceptual tools help you to think consciously about what you're doing, often just by providing names for concepts that you already had but never articulated. So when you're struggling to get a description right it's helpful to be able to ask yourself: Have we got the right description span here? Are we sure we understand the designations well enough? Have we made a spurious classification? And when you're dealing with a problem complexity it's helpful to be able to ask yourself: Is this a multi-frame problem? Is there a problem frame misfit here? Are we trying to look at shared phenomena from the point of view of only one domain?</p><p>I hope that the lexicon form of the book will work to underline its nature. It is offered as a resource from which you can take what you want, not as another orthodoxy that demands acceptance or rejection as a whole. The arrangement of the book, I hope, will encourage you to browse and skip from piece to piece, and I don't expect it to be read straight through. Inevitably, this has led to some repetition, but not enough, I hope, to seem tedious. I have tried to make each piece self-contained but, of course, that is not always possible, especially for some of the pieces about less familiar ideas--such as problem frames. So there is a full index, and cross-references, capitalized in the text, from each piece to other relevant pieces. If you're feeling puzzled by a piece it may be a good idea to follow some of the cross-references in its earlier paragraphs before reading on.</p><p>If you prefer to read more systematically, you could start with the Introduction, which comes, out of alphabetical order, at the beginning. The Introduction lays out some of the main ideas, and puts them in context. Then you can follow the cross-references from the Introduction to anything that catches your interest, and so onwards from one piece to another. There is a bibliography that expands the short and informal references--both to books and to their authors--appearing in the text and adds a few bibliographical notes.</p><p>Another way of using the book is by taking a tour around one theme or topic at a time. I've prepared some itineraries of tours you might take. Most of them are quite short and don't try to include everything about their themes. You can take them in any order. As with most tours, the time needed will depend on how long you spend on the places of interest. Some places of interest appear in more than one tour. If you visited a place on a previous tour, you could stay on the bus. On the other hand, you might see something you hadn't noticed on your first visit.</p><p>Whatever your approach to this book I hope it will be useful to you: that you will find something in it to help you in your work, to illuminate a difficulty you have struggled with, to offer amusement or insight, to provoke you to thought, or in any other way to repay you for having opened it.</p><p>Michael Jackson<br>May 1995</p><p>Acknowledgements</p><p>Much of my working life so far has been occupied with devising, teaching, and using software development methods. In the 1970s and early 1980s I was deeply involved in the JSP method of program design and the JSD method of system development. Some of the themes and ideas of this book emerge indirectly from the successes of that work; some from its failures. I learned a lot from the many people I worked with during those years--especially from John Cameron.</p><p>I also learned a lot, although I did not always realize it at the time, from some people whose ideas about method were diametrically opposed to my own. As Mark Twain said: "When I was a boy of fourteen, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to twenty-one I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years".</p><p>Many of the ideas in this book have been formed and sharpened during several years of cooperation with Pamela Zave. Particularly, they have been influenced by her approach to multiparadigm specification, and have benefited from the insightful work that she has done in cooperation with Peter Mataga on specifying telephone switching systems.</p><p>Daniel Jackson has helped me in more ways than I can count. He read the whole book in at least two of its versions and commented in detail on every part of it. He explained many things I had not known or had misunderstood. He discussed many of the topics with me at length. And he has always been ready to offer advice, encouragement, and constructive criticism at just the right moments. As a small recompense I have stolen a quotation by Niels Bohr from his PhD thesis.</p><p>Some of the ideas in the book have been aired at meetings of the Software Development Research Group of the University of the West of England, Bristol. I am grateful to the other members of the group--Barry Cawthorne, Ian Beeson, Richard McClatchey, Steve Probert, Tony Solomonides, and Chris Wallace--for their interest and help. Chris Wallace introduced me to the work on patterns in object-oriented design.</p><p>Tom DeMarco helped me generously with many acute and sensitive comments. His suggestions have removed many stumbling blocks from the reader's path.</p><p>Much of the treatment of Dekker's algorithm follows the presentation in Dick Whiddett's book Concurrent Programming for Software Engineers.</p><p>Andy Ware of Addison-Wesley has been unfailingly tolerant and courteous to an unreasonable and curmudgeonly author. And Susan Keany has been an agreeable and efficient production editor. It has been a pleasure to work with them both.</p><p></p><p>To all these people, and to everyone else who has helped me, I am very grateful. 0201877120P04062001</p><p> <b>Michael Jackson</b> has worked in software for over thirty years, during which time he has been involved in all aspects of program and system development.

One of the many creatures that commute on the Mississippi Flyway as part of an annual migration, they pass along Chicago&#x2019;s lakefront and through midwestern backyards on a path used by their species for millennia. This magnificent migrational dance takes place every year in Chicagoland, yet it is often missed by the region&#x2019;s two-legged residents. <i>The Art of Migration</i> uncovers these extraordinary patterns that play out over the seasons. Readers are introduced to over two hundred of the birds and insects that traverse regions from the edge of Lake Superior to Lake Michigan and to the rivers that flow into the Mississippi. <br><br>As the only artist in residence at the Field Museum, Peggy Macnamara has a unique vantage point for studying these patterns and capturing their distinctive traits. Her magnificent watercolor illustrations capture flocks, movement, and species-specific details. The illustrations are accompanied by text from museum staff and include details such as natural histories, notable features for identification, behavior, and how species have adapted to environmental changes. The book follows a gentle seasonal sequence and includes chapters on studying migration, artist&#x2019;s notes on illustrating wildlife, and tips on the best ways to watch for birds and insects in the Chicago area. <br><br>A perfect balance of science and art, <i>The Art of Migration</i> will prompt us to marvel anew at the remarkable spectacle going on around us.</p><p><b>Peggy Macnamara</b> has been the artist in residence at the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, for the past twenty-five years. She is also associate professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the author of <i>Painting Wildlife in Watercolor</i>, <i>Illinois Insects and Spiders</i>, and <i>Architecture by Birds and Insects</i>, the latter two also published by the University of Chicago Press.&#x201c;Most insect and bird field guides require you to encounter a species first and then wade through pages, hoping to identify whatever you encountered. In <i>The Art of Migration</i>, you learn about the species and when you can expect to encounter them. With that information, you are inspired to step outside and locate that yellow-rumped warbler or dog-day cicada. It is refreshing reading something that&#x2019;s science-based, beautiful, and fun.&#x201d; (Tom Clay, Executive Director, Illinois Audubon Society)<br><br>&#x201c;Peggy Macnamara's wonderful talent as an artist and deep understanding of science enable her to deftly capture the natural world through her watercolors.&nbsp;This is an extraordinary volume capping Peggy's insight into migratory patterns, the Chicago natural area, and seasonal change. It should be required reading for everyone concerned about our natural habitat and about the miraculous combination of senses that enable bird migration.&#x201d; (John W. McCarter Jr., president and CEO of the Field Museum)<br><br><i>"The Art of Migration&nbsp;</i>is no dry field guide or academic reference. Rather, it is a little treasure, beautiful to look at and enjoyable to read."&nbsp; (<i>Chicago Book Review</i>)<br><br>"Macnamara's paintings blend scenes of birds and insects in flight with more representational images. The transparent nature of watercolors allows her to offer context for bird migration; a map of South America or the Chicago skyline may appear layered in the background. This is not a field guide but a conversational collection of impressions."&nbsp; (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>)<br><br>"In lovely, brightly colored watercolors in <i>The Art of Migration</i>, Macnamara reminds us that even in one of the most heavily developed areas of the United States, you can still find dog-day cicadas, banded woolly-bears, kinglets, nighthawks, Snowy Owls, and countless other beautiful and wild creatures. Thank goodness." (<i>Birdwatching</i>)<br><br>"Despite the Chicago-centric presentation, the birds and insects depicted could be found anywhere east of the Mississippi at the same latitude; there is much here to appeal to non-Chicagoans. This is just a pleasing book that couples luminously alive scenes of birds and insects through the journey of the seasons." (<i>The Quarterly Review of Biology</i>)<br><br>"This is an exceptional book.

Brualdi (Author)</p><p>The market best seller. Level is dead center.Introductory Combinatorics emphasizes combinatorial ideas, including the pigeon-hole principle, counting techniques, permutations and combinations, Polya counting, binomial coefficients, inclusion-exclusion principle, generating functions and recurrence relations, and combinatortial structures (matchings, designs, graphs). Written to be entertaining and readable, this book&#39;s lively style reflects the author&#39;s joy for teaching the subject. It presents an excellent treatment of Polya&#39;s Counting Theorem that doesn&#39;t assume the student is familiar with group theory. It also includes problems that offer good practice of the principles it presents. The third edition of Introductory Combinatorics has been updated to include new material on partially ordered sets, Dilworth&#39;s Theorem, partitions of integers and generating functions. In addition, the chapters on graph theory have been completely revised. A valuable book for any reader interested in learning more about combinatorics.</p><h2>An-My L�: Small Wars</h2><p>In one of An-My Le's photographs of American Marines training for Iraq in the Mojave desert, a group of barrels is marked with the phrase &#x201c;Do Not Shoot.&#x201d; Obviously, the photographer didn't heed this warning, and the result is the most recent, timely series inof images in this compelling first monograph. Earlier photographs document a group of Vietnam War reenactors in South Carolina who, like their better-known Civil War counterparts, restage battles, training and the daily life of soldiers.

She lives in New York City.<i>Starred Review.</i> A Saigon native who defected to the U.S. as a political refugee in 1975, L�&#x2014;currently a professor of photography at Bard College&#x2014;has spent the past 20 years creating bold, simple "autobiographical still lifes," three series of which are assembled in this gorgeous new volume. Taken in startling black-and-white with a 5x7-view camera, L�'s still lifes combine the perspective and scope of landscape photography with the intimacy of portraits. And her three series&#x2014;"Vi�t Nam," "Small Wars" and "29 Palms"&#x2014;depict modern Vietnamese villagers, Vietnam War battle reenactors, and soldiers training for Iraq, respectively. Strangely serene, the photos carefully blur the lines between war- and peacetime. In "Untitled, Ho Chi Minh City, 1998," for example, which shows a park full of people and the enormous sky above, viewers are likely to mistake the darting swallows, blurry from speed, for warplanes swooping over people's heads. For her most recent series, "29 Palms," L� photographed a troop of Iraq- and Afghanistan-bound marines training in California. Juxtaposing soldiers in Nikes with faux anti-U.S.A. graffiti, L� invites viewers to consider the nature of war, as well as the gap between smaller re-creations and their larger, more violent and destructive sources. In the volume's concluding pages, essayist Richard B. Woodward provides further insight into L�'s work with an astute look at her place in photographic history. Also included is an insightful interview with journalist Hilton Als in which L� herself reveals her inspirations and techniques. This a beautifully shot and compiled collection that links L� both to old war-photo masters like Timothy O'Sullivan and to landscape genre's modern-day practitioners. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A visionary writer and outstanding rabbinic leader, Kook was a philosopher, mystic, poet, jurist, communal leader, and veritable saint. The first chief rabbi of Jewish Palestine and the founding theologian of religious Zionism, he struggled to understand and shape his revolutionary times. His life and writings resonate with the defining tensions of Jewish life and thought.</p><p>A powerfully original thinker, Rav Kook combined strict traditionalism and an embrace of modernity, Orthodoxy and tolerance, piety and audacity, scholasticism and ecstasy, and passionate nationalism with profound universalism. Though little known in the English-speaking world, his life and teachings are essential to understanding current Israeli politics, contemporary Jewish spirituality, and modern Jewish thought. This biography, the first in English in more than half a century, offers a rich and insightful portrait of the man and his complex legacy.&nbsp;Yehudah Mirsky clears away widespread misunderstandings of Kook&#x2019;s ideas and provides fresh insights into his personality and worldview. Mirsky demonstrates how Kook's richly erudite, dazzlingly poetic writings convey a breathtaking vision in which "the old will become new, and the new will become holy."</p></p><p><p>This insightful biography of Abraham Isaac Kook, the first chief rabbi of Jewish Palestine and the founding theologian of religious Zionism, recounts the extraordinary events of his life and examines his teachings and complicated legacy.</p><b>Yehudah Mirsky</b> is Professor of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies at the Schusterman Center for Israel Studies at Brandeis University.</p><h2>The Architecture of Harry Weese</h2><p><p><strong>This study tells the story of one of America&#x2019;s most gifted architects of the postwar years.</strong></p><p>During a career that spanned half a century from the 1930s to the 1980s, Weese produced a large number of significant designs ranging from small but highly inventive houses to large urban scale commissions like the Washington, D.C., Metro system. Although influenced to some degree by the rational, and often austere, work of European modernists like Mies van der Rohe, in most of his own oeuvre Weese instead followed the example of Nordic architects like Gunnar Asplund and Alvar Aalto in favoring natural materials, human scale, and comfort; his work was characterized by a deep respect for older buildings and existing urban patterns and a fondness for unexpected, often idiosyncratic design decisions.</p><p>This book takes its place within a fast-growing revival of interest in the work of Weese and a number of his friends and contemporaries with shared assumptions and sensibilities, notably Eero Saarinen, Edward Larrabee Barnes, I. M. Pei, Ralph Rapson, and Paul Rudolph. As important as Weese&#x2019;s buildings were, though, they were only one part of what almost all his contemporaries recognized as his seemingly inexhaustible creativity. Because Weese believed that design was essentially problem-solving, he was willing to apply his skills to everything from a piece of furniture to an entire city. The city on which he lavished the most attention was his own city, Chicago, where he seemed to be everywhere at once, praising, criticizing, cheerleading, and pouring out ideas for creating a humane and livable place for citizens of all walks of life.</p> 56 color and 120 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Robert Bruegmann, an historian of architecture, landscape, and the built environment, is University Distinguished Professor of Art History, Architecture and Urban Planning at the University of Illinois at Chicago.&#x201c;[T]his wonderful book by Robert Bruegmann illustrates [that Weese] was an inventive and thoughtful humanist, concerned as much with how people used and perceived his spaces as their aesthetic implications for other architects. . . .

Yet how this critical research is conducted sometimes raises serious ethical, legal, and social concerns, and it is difficult to balance the promise of biomedical research with our time-honored commitments to individual choice in such fundamental matters as control over personal health information and the disposition of our bodily tissues.<br>Weir and Olick provide a thorough analysis of this critical phase in the era of genomic medicine. While strongly supportive of the biomedical research enterprise, they develop a critique of many common research practices with banked tissues, DNA, and genetic data. Noting numerous examples of beneficial human tissue research, they focus on problematic research practices, controversial cases, and federal and institutional policies that limit the informed choices of patients and research participants. The authors offer a series of recommendations intended to limit the risks of inadequate informed consent to research for individuals, families, and groups, and to strengthen the bonds of trust between the research enterprise and the public upon which biomedical progress depends.<br>This book offers a wealth of information plus well-reasoned recommendations that will be of keen interest to geneticists, other biomedical scientists, research institutions, policymakers, students and others. It will serve as a clarion call to move beyond traditional policies and practices toward a richer understanding of partnership between patients and research participants and the biomedical research enterprise - a partnership for the benefit of all.<br></p><p>Robert F. Weir is at University of Iowa. Robert S. Olick is at SUNY Upstate Medical University.During the past decade, national, regional, and international organizations and advisory bodies, bioethicists, patient advocates, and biomedical researchers have examined the legal, ethical, and social implications of collecting, storing, and conducting research with human-tissue samples. In The Stored Tissue Issue, Weir and Olick assess the ongoing debates about and controversy over the need for and specificity of informed consent; the privacy, confidentiality, and ownership issues related to samples and the genetic information derived from them; and the extent to which commercial profits should be shared with persons and communities that give their genetic material to researchers. Although Weir and Olick cover familiar terrain, a key feature of the book is their critical analysis of the recommendations by the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) in its report, "Research Involving Human Biological Materials: Ethical Issues and Policy Guidance." Weir and Olick contend that the NBAC failed to achieve "the right balance" between the desire to protect persons who give researchers their tissue and genetic material and the goal of promoting biomedical research. For instance, the authors note that when the interests of persons are in conflict with the interests of researchers on matters of informed consent, the NBAC consistently offers policy recommendations that favor the interests of biomedical researchers. The authors assert that such recommendations underplay the mutual interests that both parties have in controlling the conditions of tissue research, as well as the importance of individual choice as a key feature of the principle of informed consent. Indeed, Weir and Olick point out that surveys of public opinion indicate that people want information about how researchers propose to use their genetic samples, and they want control over the uses to which their samples will be put. Weir and Olick also show that the recommendations of the NBAC do not reflect some of the common themes found in several international policy statements. Among these are the notion of human dignity, the right of people to control how their samples are used, and the commercial aspects of research that involves the use of genetic samples. Drawing from these themes, the authors issue a list of recommendations that differ from the NBAC approach, particularly with regard to informed consent. They recommend that researchers and institutions disclose detailed information about policies that concern the collection, storage, use, privacy, and commercial benefit of genetic samples; that institutional review boards have a more active role in overseeing research that involves stored samples; and that institutions provide institutional review boards with the resources they need to do a thorough and responsible job. Weir and Olick recommend that U.S. regulations on human research require disclosure by researchers about financial conflicts of interest and commercial gain, strengthen the requirements for informed consent in tissue research, state explicitly that persons have a right to self-determination over the use of their samples, require community consultation as well as community approval and individual consent for the collection of genetic samples from identifiable groups, and redefine the standard for minimal risk of harm so that potential psychosocial injuries and adverse effects on groups as a result of research with genetic samples are included in the definition. The authors say that their recommendations are "intended to be reasonable, realistic, and productive of significant change" toward improving the practices used in the collection and storage of tissue samples and the research that involves them. What Weir and Olick do not say is whether the growing list of conflicting recommendations can be brought into harmony at the national and international levels and how such harmony can be accomplished. Nonetheless, as research with banked tissues and genetic material and data continues to increase, all who hold a stake in this area should give careful attention to the authors' assessment of the problematic ethical issues and their call for greater collaboration among researchers, institutions, and persons who participate in tissue research. <i>Karen J.

It is an ideal first introduction before students encounter more difficult readings from critical and postmodern perspectives. Nealon and Giroux describe key concepts and illuminate each with an engaging inquiry that asks students to consider deeper and deeper questions. Written in students&#39; own idiom, and drawing its examples from the social world, literature, popular culture, and advertising, The Theory Toolbox offers students the language and opportunity to theorize rather than positioning them to respond to theory as a reified history of various schools of thought. Clear and engaging, it avoids facile description, inviting students to struggle with ideas and the world by virtue of the book&#39;s relentless challenge to common assumptions and its appeal to common sense.</p><p>Jeffrey T. Nealon teaches in the English department at Penn State University. He is author of several &#39;theory&#39; books: Double Reading: Postmodernism after Deconstruction(1993), Alterity Politics: Ethics and Performative Subjectivity(1998), and the co-edited collection Rethinking the Frankfurt School: Alternative Legacies of Cultural Critique (2002).

An entire education in one tidy package. Students will find it invaluable, and advanced scholars will read it under the covers at night. (McGowan, John)<br><br>From their opening engagement with the punk song 'Why Theory?,' Nealon and Searls Giroux perform an impassioned and compelling argument for the productive work of theory as a crucial social action. As the title suggests, <i>The Theory Toolbox</i>, instead of simply reviewing schools of theory and criticism, aims to help students figure out what they can do with theoretical concepts as tools for living. Organized to provide a productive immersion in key concepts such as agency and ideology, <i>The Theory Toolbox</i> engenders pragmatic encounters with theorists from Nietzsche to Deleuze. Through pertinent political and social examples, Nealon and Searls Giroux succeed in demonstrating why theory matters and, most remarkably, why postmodern theory matters in everyday life. In succeeding, they make a critical intervention in undergraduate education and in wider debates over theory and practice. This book should be required reading for all students desiring to become thinking citizens. (Kevin DeLuca)<br><br><i>The Theory Toolbox</i> is original and unusual, breaking the standard mold of social theory textbooks. It puts itself in the young theory student's shoes and imagines what s/he needs to know, and how best to convey difficult material.

Emile Perreau-Saussine investigates the church's response to liberal democracy, a political system for which the church was utterly unprepared.</p><p>Looking at leading philosophers and political theologians--among them Joseph de Maistre, Alexis de Tocqueville, and Charles P�guy--Perreau-Saussine shows how the church redefined its relationship to the State in the long wake of the French Revolution. Disenfranchised by the fall of the monarchy, the church in France at first embraced that most conservative of ideologies, "ultramontanism" (an emphasis on the central role of the papacy). Catholics whose church had lost its national status henceforth looked to the papacy for spiritual authority. Perreau-Saussine argues that this move paradoxically combined a fundamental repudiation of the liberal political order with an implicit acknowledgment of one of its core principles, the autonomy of the church from the state. However, as Perreau-Saussine shows, in the context of twentieth-century totalitarianism, the Catholic Church retrieved elements of its Gallican heritage and came to embrace another liberal (and Gallican) principle, the autonomy of the state from the church, for the sake of its corollary, freedom of religion. Perreau-Saussine concludes that Catholics came to terms with liberal democracy, though not without abiding concerns about the potential of that system to compromise freedom of religion in the pursuit of other goals.</p></p><p><p>"Many people think that the reconciliation of the Catholic Church and liberal democracy consummated at Vatican II represents a sudden shift. Perreau-Saussine shows to the contrary that it has deep roots in the history of the church, and in particular in the Gallicanism of ancien regime France. Even Vatican I can be seen as a stage on this long march. This rich and fascinating book sheds much light on what this reconciliation means--and what it couldn't mean."<b>--Charles Taylor, professor emeritus, McGill University</b></p><p>"The modest title of this erudite and thoughtful book belies its actual achievement. It makes an important contribution to understanding a topic that seems likely to occupy thinking people in the West for some time to come: the general relation between politics and religion in the modern world."<b>--Raymond Geuss, author of <i>Philosophy and Real Politics</i></b></p><p>"<i>Catholicism and Democracy</i> is a wonderfully fresh interpretation of the fascinating and tortuous path of Catholic political theology over the last two hundred years. With its strong narrative, this original book required me to turn the historical frame upside down and look at issues in a new way."<b>--F. Russell Hittinger, University of Tulsa</b></p><p>"<i>Catholicism and Democracy</i> looks at some of the ironies and paradoxes inherent in the relationship of the Catholic Church to modern politics. Deftly weaving together political history and literary interpretations of that history, Perreau-Saussine tells an important story with persuasion and brilliant insight."<b>--James B. Murphy, Dartmouth College</b></p><b>Emile Perreau-Saussine</b> (1972-2010) was a lecturer in the Department of Politics and International Studies at the University of Cambridge.

Demolishing the myth of Gwen John (1876-1939) as a recluse, this new survey explores the art world at the center of these cities and reveals the alliances and differences the artist had with her contemporaries. John&#39;s representation of the female nude, her paintings of interiors, and the effects of her Catholic faith on her work are all considered. The author also discusses the key relationship between John&#39;s position as a woman artist and her fascination with the portrayal of the female sitter.</p><p><b>Alicia Foster</b> is an independent art historian, recently specializing in the work of Gwen John.Although largely ignored in her lifetime, John's work is now acclaimed by artists and art historians. This beautifully illustrated book offers an excellent study of John's life and artistic development. Langdale examines the passionate but reclusive John in a historical context that includes her acquaintances with Rodin, Picasso, and many other artists. Her research helps to explain why, despite the paring down of detail, the figural distortion, the coolness of tone, and the exaggerated plainness of the models, John's paintings emerge with contained emotion. An excellent resource, recommended for all readers interested in art.

It incorporates the internationally recognized system of line numbers for critical reference.</p><p><i>Ulysses</i> has been labeled dirty, blasphemous, and unreadable. In a famous 1933 court decision, Judge John M. Woolsey declared it an emetic book--although he found it sufficiently unobscene to allow its importation into the United States--and Virginia Woolf was moved to decry James Joyce's "cloacal obsession." None of these adjectives, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains <i>the</i> modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. It is funny, sorrowful, and even (in a close-focus sort of way) suspenseful. And despite the exegetical industry that has sprung up in the last 75 years, <i>Ulysses</i> is also a compulsively readable book. Even the verbal vaudeville of the final chapters can be navigated with relative ease, as long as you're willing to be buffeted, tickled, challenged, and (occasionally) vexed by Joyce's sheer command of the English language.<p> Among other things, a novel is simply a long story, and the first question about any story is: <i>What happens?</i>. In the case of <i>Ulysses</i>, the answer might be <i>Everything</i>. William Blake, one of literature's sublime myopics, saw the universe in a grain of sand. Joyce saw it in Dublin, Ireland, on June 16, 1904, a day distinguished by its utter normality. Two characters, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, go about their separate business, crossing paths with a gallery of indelible Dubliners. We watch them teach, eat, stroll the streets, argue, and (in Bloom's case) masturbate. And thanks to the book's stream-of-consciousness technique--which suggests no mere stream but an impossibly deep, swift-running river--we're privy to their thoughts, emotions, and memories. The result? Almost every variety of human experience is crammed into the accordian folds of a single day, which makes <i>Ulysses</i> not just an experimental work but the very last word in realism. </p><p> Both characters add their glorious intonations to the music of Joyce's prose. Dedalus's accent--that of a freelance aesthetician, who dabbles here and there in what we might call Early Yeats Lite--will be familiar to readers of <i>Portrait of an Artist As a Young Man</i>. But Bloom's wistful sensualism (and naive curiosity) is something else entirely. Seen through his eyes, a rundown corner of a Dublin graveyard is a figure for hope and hopelessness, mortality and dogged survival: "Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody really?" --<i>James Marcus</i></p>The 1934 text, as corrected and reset in 1961. Ulysses is one of the most influential novels of the twentieth century. It was not easy to find a publisher in America willing to take it on, and when Jane Jeap and Margaret Anderson started printing extracts from the book their literary magazine The Little Review in 1918, they were arrested and charged with publishing obscenity. They were fined $100, and even The New York Times expressed satisfaction with their conviction. Ulysses was not published in book form until 1922, when another American woman, Sylvia Beach, published it in Paris for her Shakespeare &amp; Company. Ulysses was not available legally in any English-speaking country until 1934, when Random House successfully defended Joyce against obscenity charges and published it in the Modern Library. This edition follows the complete and unabridged text as corrected and reset in 1961. Judge John Woolsey's decision lifting the ban against Ulysses is reprinted, along with a letter from Joyce to Bennett Cerf, the publisher of Random House, and the original foreword to the book by Morris L. Ernst, who defended Ulysses during the trial.</p><h2>No One Would Listen: A True Financial Thriller</h2><p><b>Harry Markopolos and his team of financial sleuths discuss first-hand how they cracked the Madoff Ponzi scheme</b> <p><i>No One Would Listen</i> is the thrilling story of how the Harry Markopolos, a little-known number cruncher from a Boston equity derivatives firm, and his investigative team uncovered Bernie Madoff's scam years before it made headlines, and how they desperately tried to warn the government, the industry, and the financial press.</p> <p>Page by page, Markopolos details his pursuit of the greatest financial criminal in history, and reveals the massive fraud, governmental incompetence, and criminal collusion that has changed thousands of lives forever-as well as the world's financial system.</p> <ul> <li>The only book to tell the story of Madoff's scam and the SEC's failings by those who saw both first hand</li> <li>Describes how Madoff was enabled by investors and fiduciaries alike</li> <li>Discusses how the SEC missed the red flags raised by Markopolos</li> </ul> <p>Despite repeated written and verbal warnings to the SEC by Harry Markopolos, Bernie Madoff was allowed to continue his operations. <i>No One Would Listen</i> paints a vivid portrait of Markopolos and his determined team of financial sleuths, and what impact Madoff's scam will have on financial markets and regulation for decades to come.</p></p><p><strong>Harry Markopolos and his team of financial sleuths discuss first-hand how they cracked the Madoff Ponzi scheme</strong> <p><em>No One Would Listen</em> is the exclusive story of the Harry Markopolos-lead investigation into Bernie Madoff and his $65 billion Ponzi scheme.

Marko Pogacnik&#x2019;s work as a conceptual land artist, environmental healer, and educator reveals that, although the succession of subtle changes within the human body that he has observed over the last 15 years has been supported by the ongoing systemic changes of Gaia&#x2019;s planetary body, there is no doubt that if we continue to ignore Gaia, there will be no escaping the devastating effects of the ever more visible global Earth transformation process, the so-called Climate Changes.<br><br>Using his experience in exploring the landscape through geomantic work, Marko approaches the human body with a similar kind of multidimensional perception. Decoding the human body in the context of what he calls Gaia&#x2019;s Earthly Cosmos, he shows us how to consciously enter our own body space to experience it from inside and to activate our potentials to prepare our body to meet the challenges of the coming changes.<br><br>As a practical guide as well as a theoretical introduction to the universe of the human body, the concepts in this book are complemented with exercises that were inspired by the elementals and other beings of many sacred places of the Earth. These Gaia Touch body exercises are a combination of imaginations and body movements in the form of body &#x201c;cosmograms,&#x201d; which is a universal language that can be perceived by other beings of the Earth and the cosmos. Practicing these exercises will stimulate personal development in a way that enables us to become conscious co-creators with Gaia of the new emerging reality that will touch all levels of existence on the Earth.<br></p><p><b>Marko Pogacnik</b>&nbsp;is UNESCO Artist for Peace 2016 to 2018.

Bitterly humiliated by the famous Scopes "monkey trial," this once respected movement retreated from the public forum and seemed doomed to extinction. Yet fundamentalism not only survived, but in the 1940s it reemerged as a thriving and influential public movement. And today it is impossible to read a newspaper or watch cable TV without seeing the presence of fundamentalism in American society. In <em>Revive Us Again</em>, Joel A. Carpenter illuminates this remarkable transformation, exploring the history of American fundamentalism from 1925 to 1950, the years when, to non-fundamentalists, the movement seemed invisible. <br> Skillfully blending painstaking research, telling anecdotes, and astute analysis, Carpenter--a scholar who has spent twenty years studying American evangelicalism--brings this era into focus for the first time. He reveals that, contrary to the popular opinion of the day, fundamentalism was alive and well in America in the late 1920s, and used its isolation over the next two decades to build new strength from within. The book describes how fundamentalists developed a pervasive network of organizations outside of the church setting and quietly strengthened the movement by creating their own schools and organizations, many of which are prominent today, including Fuller Theological Seminary and the publishing and radio enterprises of the Moody Bible Institute. Fundamentalists also used youth movements and missionary work and, perhaps most significantly, exploited the burgeoning mass media industry to spread their message, especially through the powerful new medium of radio. Indeed, starting locally and growing to national broadcasts, evangelical preachers reached millions of listeners over the airwaves, in much the same way evangelists preach through television today. All this activity received no publicity outside of fundamentalist channels until Billy Graham burst on the scene in 1949. Carpenter vividly recounts how the charismatic preacher began packing stadiums with tens of thousands of listeners daily, drawing fundamentalism firmly back into the American consciousness after twenty years of public indifference.<br> Alongside this vibrant history, Carpenter also offers many insights into fundamentalism during this period, and he describes many of the heated internal debates over issues of scholarship, separatism, and the role of women in leadership. Perhaps most important, he shows that the movement has never been stagnant or purely reactionary. It is based on an evolving ideology subject to debate, and dissension: a theology that adapts to changing times. <br> <em>Revive Us Again</em> is more than an enlightening history of fundamentalism. Through his reasoned, objective approach to a topic that is all too often reduced to caricature, Carpenter brings fresh insight into the continuing influence of the fundamentalist movement in modern America,and its role in shaping the popular evangelical movements of today.<br></p><p><br><strong>Joel A. Carpenter</strong> is Provost of Calvin College, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He has also been the Director of the Institute for the Study of American Evangelicals at Wheaton College as well as Director of the Religion Program of The Pew Charitable Trusts in Philadelphia.<br>In 1925, H.L. Mencken scoffed that if he heaved an egg out of a Pullman window anywhere in the country, he would hit a fundamentalist. But by 1930, defeated by their public humiliation in the Scopes ``monkey trial,'' those same fundamentalists seemed to have disappeared. Or had they? In this groundbreaking new book, historian Carpenter, provost of Calvin College, argues that fundamentalists did not vanish in the 1930s and '40s--they went underground and built a unique and powerful subculture, with Bible schools, foreign mission societies, seminaries, camp meetings, and mom-and-pop publishing houses. Carpenter traces the vitality of the fundamentalist movement from 1925 to 1950, arguing that fundamentalism actually expanded during the '30s, when mainline Protestants were experiencing a precipitous decline. What's more, these militantly antimodern crusaders eagerly embraced the most cutting-edge of mediums, radio, to proclaim their old-time gospel message. Radio evangelists like Paul Rader and Charles Fuller gave fundamentalists a respectability they had coveted since Mencken's hurtful depictions of them as ignorant backwater bumpkins. Radio was fundamentalism's entry into many American homes. In the 1940s, the highly successful Youth for Christ movement built on this media-savvy precedent, gaining mass appeal with slick publicity campaigns and evangelists be-bopping from the pulpit to contemporary big-band tunes. So when the nation as a whole began turning to religion in the anxious days of WW II and its aftermath, fundamentalists were at the ready with their well-established infrastructure. The ``prophet'' who arose from this fundamentalist subculture and was a product of its Bible schools, radio ministries, and revival circuits was the legendary Billy Graham, who helped bring fundamentalism further into the American mainstream. A valuable contribution to a critical but neglected era in fundamentalist studies. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The six published novels are now undisputed classics. The manuscripts, however, despite the extraordinary writing they contain and the way in which they illuminate Jane Austen&#x2019;s work as a novelist, are much less well known. From the brilliance of the juvenilia to the urbane modernity of &#x2018;Sanditon&#x2019; these works show Austen pushing the conventional boundaries of fiction, exploring the implications of vulgarity and violence, experimenting with different styles and tones, and practicing and refining her arts of narrative. </p> <p> This Broadview Edition includes &#x201c;Lady Susan,&#x2019; &#x201c;The Watsons,&#x201d; &#x201c;Sanditon,&#x201d; and ten important early manuscript works. Historical appendices include Austen&#x2019;s letters on fiction; continuations written by Austen&#x2019;s niece and nephew of two of her early works; and Sir Walter Scott&#x2019;s important critical appraisal of Austen from 1816. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Linda Bree</strong> is Editorial Director, Arts and Literature at the Cambridge University Press and the editor of the Broadview Edition of Jane Austen&#x2019;s <em>Persuasion</em>. </p> <p> <strong>Peter Sabor</strong> is Professor of English and Canada Research Chair in Eighteenth Century Studies at McGill University, and the editor of the Broadview Edition of Sarah Fielding&#x2019;s <em>The History of Ophelia</em>. </p> <p> <strong>Janet Todd</strong> is President of Lucy Cavendish College, University of Cambridge and the co-editor of the Broadview Edition of Charlotte Smith&#x2019;s <em>Desmond</em>. </p><p> &#x201c;As the informative and scholarly Introduction suggests, these manuscript works, with their combination of boisterous satire and cool detachment, throw a startling light on Jane Austen&#x2019;s writing practices and the achievements of her great novels.

Shakespeare depicted him as a tragic figure, an irresponsible, cruel monarch who nevertheless rose in stature as the substance of power slipped from him. By later writers he has been variously portrayed as a half-crazed autocrat or a conventional ruler whose principal errors were the mismanagement of his nobility and disregard for the political conventions of his age. This book&#x2015;the first full-length biography of Richard in more than fifty years&#x2015;offers a radical reinterpretation of the king.<br><br>Nigel Saul paints a picture of Richard as a highly assertive and determined ruler, one whose key aim was to exalt and dignify the crown. In Richard's view, the crown was threatened by the factiousness of the nobility and the assertiveness of the common people. The king met these challenges by exacting obedience, encouraging lofty new forms of address, and constructing an elaborate system of rule by bonds and oaths. Saul traces the sources of Richard's political ideas and finds that he was influenced by a deeply felt orthodox piety and by the ideas of the civil lawyers. He shows that, although Richard's kingship resembled that of other rulers of the period, unlike theirs, his reign ended in failure because of tactical errors and contradictions in his policies. For all that he promoted the image of a distant, all-powerful monarch, Richard II's rule was in practice characterized by faction and feud. The king was obsessed by the search for personal security: in his subjects, however, he bred only insecurity and fear.<br><br>A revealing portrait of a complex and fascinating figure, the book is essential reading for anyone with an interest in the politics and culture of the English middle ages.</p><p>Nigel Saul paints a picture of Richard as a highly assertive and determined ruler, one whose key aim was to exalt and dignify the crown.

This bold new book&#x2013;&#x2013;taking the name of this work by Benton&#x2013;&#x2013;examines the intersections between Regionalist and Modernist paintings, photography, and film during the Great Depression, a period when the two approaches to art making were perhaps at their zenith.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is commonly believed that Regionalist artists Benton, John Steuart Curry, and Grant Wood reacted to the economic and social devastation of their era by harking back in tranquil bucolic paintings to a departed utopia. However, this volume compares their work to that of photographers such as Dorothea Lange and Ben Shahn and filmmakers such as Josef von Sternberg&#x2015;all of whom documented the desolation of the Depression&#x2015;and finds surprising commonalities. The book also notes intriguing connections between Regionalist artists and Modernists Jackson Pollock and Philip Guston, countering prevailing assumptions that Regionalism was an anathema to these New York School painters and showing their shared fascination with the Midwest.</p></p><p><p>Debra Bricker Balken is an independent curator and scholar.

In other words, the text is appropriate for students...I...love the overall writing style; it&#39;s personal and easy to read...&#34;</p><h2>Popes, Peasants, and Shepherds: Recipes and Lore from Rome and Lazio (Volume 42)</h2><p>The food of Rome and its region, Lazio, is redolent of herbs, olive oil, ricotta, lamb, and pork. It is the food of ordinary, frugal people, yet it is a very modern cuisine in that it gives pride of place to the essential flavors of its ingredients. In this only English-language book to encompass the entire region, the award-winning author of <i>Encyclopedia of Pasta</i>, Oretta Zanini De Vita, offers a substantial and complex social history of Rome and Lazio through the story of its food. Including more than 250 authentic, easy-to-follow recipes, the author leads readers on an exhilarating journey from antiquity through the Middle Ages to the mid-twentieth century.</p><p>"This superlative collaboration between author and translator has produced the very best kind of cookbook: authoritative but exciting, scholarly but racily written&#x2015;everything the cook or scholar wants to know about the traditional food of the region around Rome.&#x201d; &#x2015;Paul Levy, editor of <i>The Penguin Book of Food and Drink</i><br><br>&#x201c;Oretta Zanini and Maureen Fant are the very two experts I would consult first with any question on Roman cuisine, and this product of their collaboration is as rich and complex as a classic <i>coda alla vaccinara</i> (their recipe for which happens to be delicious). The breadth of information presented here is impressive and the selection of recipes refreshingly authentic, including intestines, heart, sweetbreads, and other delicacies of the <i>quinto quarto</i> so often left out of books on Rome published outside of Italy. At a time when Tuscany and Sicily occupy so much space in our collective Italian fantasies, it&#x2019;s a pleasure to have a definitive exploration of Roman cuisine to put on the shelf or bring into the kitchen.&#x201d; &#x2015;Mitchell Davis, The James Beard Foundation<br><br>"Zanini has written a fascinating profile of a region of Italy almost unknown to Americans--and that's strange because it's the region of the country&#x2019;s best-known city, Rome. But Lazio and the Roman countryside remain a <i>terra incognita</i> despite their rich history and very rich culinary culture, all of which helped make Rome the center of the universe for many centuries and a place of endless enchantment to this day. Here are dishes that have traversed the ages and flavors that once beguiled Caesar just as they do modern tourists. Zanini provides astute analysis of how and why Romans and the people of Lazio eat what they do--and moreover, she gives us recipes so we can try them in our own kitchens." &#x2015;Nancy Harmon Jenkins, author of <i>The Essential Mediterranean: How Regional Cooks Transform Key Ingredients into the World&#x2019;s Favorite Cuisines</i>Oretta Zanini De Vita is a distinguished Italian food historian.

The volume responds primarily to the twenty-first century's inescapable evidence of the terms of black life&#x2015;not so much new as newly visible. The poems trace a whole web of connections between the kinds of violence that affect people across the racial, ethnic, gender, class, sexual, national, and linguistic boundaries that do and do not divide us. How do we protect our humanity, our ability to feel deeply and think freely, in the face of a seemingly endless onslaught of physical, social, and environmental abuses? Where do we find language to describe, process, and check the attacks and injuries we see and suffer? What actions can break us out of the soul-numbing cycle of emotions, moving through outrage, mourning, and despair, again and again? In poems that span fragment to narrative and quiz to constraint, from procedure to prose and sequence to song, semiautomatic culls past and present for guides to a hoped-for future.</p><p>EVIE SHOCKLEY is the author of several collections of poetry, including a half-red sea and the new black. She has won the Hurston/Wright Legacy Award in Poetry, the Holmes National Poetry Prize, and fellowships from Cave Canem, MacDowell, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture of the New York Public Library. She currently is an associate professor of English at Rutgers University New Brunswick."Evie Shockley suggests that poetry is necessary to seeing, surviving with equilibrium and wholeness in this period's vital and precarious junctures. The poems in semiautomatic are on fire. This will make an excellent source book of poetic form and historically grounded black aesthetics for the classroom." &#x2015;Erica Hunt, Long Island University<br><br>"Evie Shockley's&nbsp;semiautomatic goes beyond mere weaponry.&nbsp; This book is revelatory.&nbsp; A tool in the chest of cultural workers, a vocabulary that resists decoration; this is self-portraiture and truth-telling at its best. From her epic 'the topsy suite' to her one-acts (a new form), through her fearless lens and appropriation of authorities, there's no level of denial or proof-vest that will protect you from Shockley's poetry.&nbsp; You can run, Reader, but you will not be able to look the other way."&nbsp; &#x2015;Willie Perdomo, author of The Essential Hits of Shorty Bon Bon<br><br>"This is an extraordinary, wonderful book. Evie Shockley is a great black poet. I know she might not put it that way, and sees all of what's problematic in my putting it that way. Her greatness is in that, too. She makes revolution irresistible just like she heard we should." &#x2015;Fred Moten, author of The Little Edges<br><br>"There is no keener mind in American poetry than Shockley's, with her quick turns and inflections, slipping between subjectivity and documentary, between verse and refrain. Her poems engage&#x2015;politically, formally, historically, profoundly&#x2015;with the redistribution of power through language. Read this book and get shook." &#x2015;D. A.

Mozart</h2><p>Hermann Abert's classic biography, first published in German more than eighty years ago and itself based on the definitive mid-nineteenth century study by Otto Jahn, remains the most informed and substantial biography of Mozart in any language. The book is both the fullest account of the composer&#x2019;s life and a deeply skilled analysis of his music.<br>Proceeding chronologically from 1756 to 1791, the book interrogates every aspect of Mozart&#x2019;s life, influences, and experience; his personality; his religious and secular dimensions; and the social context of the time. In a book within a book,&#x201d; Abert also provides close scrutiny of the music, including the operas, orchestral work, symphonies and piano concertos, church music and cantatas, and compositions for solo instruments.<br>While the tone of Abert&#x2019;s great work is expertly rendered by Stewart Spencer, developments in Mozart scholarship since the last German edition are signaled by the Mozart scholar, Cliff Eisen, in careful annotations on every page.

A recipient of many awards and honors, she is an honorary member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters and, in France, an Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters. Muriel Spark was created a Dame of the British Empire in 1993. She passed away in April 2006.The peerless author of A Far Cry from Kensington brings to her latest work a comedian's split-second timing and a classical fascination with fatality. Ten stylish Londoners assemble for a dinner party: as Charterhouse, the all-too-well-named butler, offers each course, Spark serves up a mercilessly economical history of the two hosts, their various guests and the distinguished Hilda Damien, who is expected "to look in" after dinner. But early on Spark has privileged the reader with information that might be shocking were it not so shrewdly incorporated: "But Hilda Damien will not come in after dinner. She is dying, now, as they speak." Polished and witty, the narrative cuts from the banquet to episodes in the recent past that link Hilda's death to her associations with the other characters. Especially scrutinized is odd young Margaret, Hilda's new daughter-in-law, whose proximity to the victims of apparently unrelated and bizarre murders engenders the suspicions of even her fond father. Spark's exquisitely balanced tone proves that the richest comedy is that which explores the darkest themes. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Close Relationships: Key Readings (Key Readings in Social Psychology)</h2><p>Each of the chapters in this reader is written by leading scholars in the area of relationships, reflecting the diversity of the field and including both contemporary and key historical papers for comprehensive coverage of research.</p><p><strong>Harry T.

Using this fix-it-and-forget-it approach, you can produce complete and authentic Indian meals that taste like they came from Mumbai, New Delhi, and Bangalore, or your favorite Indian restaurant.<br><br> Featuring both classic and innovative recipes such as Pork Vindaloo, Kashmiri Potato Curry, Date and Tamarind Chutney, and Curried Chickpeas, these full-flavor, no-fuss dishes are perfect for busy cooks any day of the week.</p><p>NEELA PANIZ grew up in Bombay, India. After moving to the US, Paniz opened Chutney's Indian take-out and the hugely successful Bombay Cafe in Los Angeles, and a contemporary Indian restaurant, Neela's, in Napa. She is also the author of&nbsp;<i>The Bombay Cafe</i>, which put her on the national map as one of the leading voices of contemporary Indian cuisine. Since selling her restaurants, Paniz has appeared as the winning contestant on <i>Chopped</i>, taught cooking classes, provided recipes for many magazine articles, and been a presenter at The Culinary Institute of America.Introduction<br><br> When I was asked if I would be interested in writing a book on Indian slow cooking, my immediate thought was that it was not possible to achieve in a slow cooker what one did in a saucepan. Indian food is based on slowly built combinations of spices and aromatics&#x2014;you patiently brown the onions, fry the spices, roast the vegetables, tending to the pot to keep all moving along without sticking or burning. The slow cooker would be a new route to a crucial destination: the vibrant, deeply satisfying flavors of traditional curries, dals, chutneys, and more. I didn&#x2019;t know if it could be done.<br><br> My memories of Chandan, the cook my mother employed for over forty years, helped me decide to take the challenge. Chandan treated us to the most amazing meals full of vibrant flavors. He would buy fresh produce and meats from the market every day, seeking out the best quality and value. You could hear him, busy in the kitchen, butchering or grinding the meat, cleaning the poultry and seafood, and prepping the vegetables. And then there would be the sound of the spices being ground in a stone grinder. The bottom slab of stone had been pounded with small depressions to create a rough surface; the top, smaller stone resembled a thin brick. Chandan would sit on his haunches and grind dry spices between the stones, or make a paste of spices with ginger, garlic, and chiles. In the mid-1970s, on one of my visits home to India, I bought my mother a food processor, and Chandan could not have been more delighted to have this modern method of grinding his spices. Of course, it would never be quite the same as the stone grinder, but it saved his back. As time went on, more modern conveniences made their way into my mother&#x2019;s kitchen. When Chandan retired and Prem Singh took over the duties of the kitchen, I rarely saw the old pathar (stone) come out of its hiding hole. He was a modern cook, using the food processor, spice grinder, juicer, blender, and pressure cooker. I wager he would have made great use of a slow cooker.<br><br> I soon realized that since Indian food is slow cooking, the slow cooker makes sense. Dals are perfect in a slow cooker, especially those that need long cooking to break down into a creamy consistency. However, Indian recipes do require some additional steps to achieve the maximum flavor and stay true to the dish. We use many whole spices or seeds that need to be &#x201c;popped&#x201d; in hot oil or ghee. Meats, poultry, seafood, and some vegetables are stewed slowly in sauces, or masalas, which are in turn created by roasting spices combined with fresh aromatic ingredients such as ginger, garlic, onions, tomatoes, and coconut milk. For example, the base of many curries&#x2014;the masala&#x2014;starts with onions cooked to a deep, dark golden brown so that they may dissolve smoothly into the dish.<br><br> I was visiting with my family in India during the latter half of my research and recipe testing. I had one slow cooker shipped from the United States and, with much difficulty, located another in a store (as they said, &#x201c;No one in India uses a slow cooker.&#x201d;). We borrowed a smaller one from a friend, for testing the chutneys; hers had sat on the top shelf of her kitchen, practically unused.<br> It was interesting to get the reactions of not only the family, who relished the dishes as they came out of the slow cookers, but also of the kitchen help, who found it fascinating that they could prep and then set the dish in the slow cooker on the counter and not have to worry about it again. There were times when we recognized that some of the textures differed, due to the lack of constant attention, but as a rule we were all awed by the flavors it produced&#x2014;especially when the biryanis came out picture perfect. My sister&#x2019;s cook, Gopi, actually created the recipe for Pumpkin with Fennel and Tamarind Chutney on page 95; due to its deliciousness, and to his delight with the ease of its preparation, this dish was a winner.<br><br> Though there are many Indian cookbooks in the market, home cooks are often still wary of trying their hand at Indian food. Among other things, the standard Indian meal requires so many preparations to complete the plate: one must have either chawal (rice) or chapattis (flat breads), along with a curry (whether nonvegetarian or vegetarian), often a dal (stewed lentils or other legumes), and a raita (yogurt relish) or chutney as an accompaniment.<br><br> In this book, I have concentrated on offering you a variety of Indian regional curries, dals, chutneys, and vegetable side dishes that can work as sides for the curries; there are also some soups and rice dishes that can serve as the center of a meal. The assumption is that you are not going to have more than one slow cooker preparing varieties of dishes for a single meal, so a great many of these dishes can stand as the main dish in a meal, along with plain rice or chapatti (I have included recipes for these and other basics and accompaniments in the first chapter) and a relish or two. Note: I used a 6-quart slow cooker for testing almost all the recipes included in this book and have noted where the recipe can be halved and prepared in a smaller, 31&#x2044;2-quart slow cooker.<br>----------------------------------------------------<br><br>Chicken Soup with Rice, Spinach, and Tomatoes&nbsp;murghi shorba<br><br> One of the more popular dishes we served at the Bombay Caf� was murghi shorba. I wanted to offer a soup beyond lentils, so using the basic method of another popular dish, Saut�ed Chicken with Green Mango Powder (page 40), I came up with an Indian version of chicken and rice soup. Like any good chicken soup, it is a wonderful comfort for those ailing with a cold&#x2014;and the addition of chiles certainly clears your sinuses!<br><br> If you are looking to make a stock without the flavors of the whole spices, just leave them out. If using this method for the chicken stock required in the Mulligatawny Soup recipe on page 41, do not add the ginger, chiles, cardamom, cassia, or cloves.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Stock</b><br> 1 (4-to 41&#x2044;2-pound) chicken, skinned and cut up <br> (see page 21)<br> 10 cups water<br> 1 large yellow onion, <br> cut into 6 pieces<br> 8 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped<br> 1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped<br> 3 serrano chiles, with seeds, <br> cut into 3 pieces each<br> 1 carrot, peeled and <br> cut into 1-inch rounds<br> 1 tomato, quartered<br> 4 whole black cardamom pods<br> 1 (2-inch) piece cassia, <br> broken in half<br> 8 cloves<br> 8 to 10 whole black peppercorns<br> 11&#x2044;2 teaspoons salt<br> 1 cup hot cooked rice<br> 1 large tomato, seeded and diced small<br> 10 to 12 large spinach leaves, julienned<br> 1&#x2044;4 cup chopped cilantro,<br> for garnish<br> 1 serrano chile, minced, <br> for garnish (optional)&nbsp;<br> 1 lemon, cut into 8 wedges, <br> for garnish<br>Before prepping the ingredients, turn the slow cooker on to the high setting for <br> 15 minutes, until the insert is warmed through.<br><br> To make the stock, add the backbone and wing tips of the cut up chicken to the heated slow cooker along with the water, onion, garlic, ginger, chiles, carrot, tomato, cardamom, cassia, cloves, peppercorns, and salt. Turn the cooker to low and cook for 4 hours.<br> Add the rest of the chicken pieces, turn the cooker to high, and continue to cook for another 2 hours.<br><br> Transfer the pieces of chicken to a platter. Strain the stock and set aside in a saucepan; keep hot on the stovetop until ready to serve. Shred enough chicken to make 11&#x2044;2 cups; reserve the rest for another use, such as Saut�ed Chicken with Green Mango Powder (page 40).<br> Prepare 8 soup bowls with equal amounts of the rice, tomato, spinach, and shredded chicken. Pour hot stock into the bowls, garnish with cilantro, minced serrano chile, and lemon wedges, and serve.<br><br> <b>&nbsp;Note</b> To cook chicken for Saut�ed Chicken with Green Mango Powder (page 40), increase the number of chickens to two, weighing about 3 pounds each, skinned and cut into 6 pieces each. Reserve the resulting stock for another use.<br></p><h2>The Spectre of Alexander Wolf (Pushkin Collection)</h2><p>Of all my memories, of all my life's innumerable sensations, the most onerous was that of the single murder I had committed.'<br>A man comes across a short story which recounts in minute detail his killing of a soldier, long ago - from the victim's point of view. It's a story that should not exist, and whose author can only be a dead man. So begins the strange quest for the elusive writer 'Alexander Wolf'. A singular classic, <i>The Spectre of Alexander Wolf</i> is a psychological thriller and existential inquiry into guilt and redemption, coincidence and fate, love and death.</p><p>Gaito Gazdanov (Georgi Ivanovich Gazdanov, 1903-1971) was the son of a forester. Born in St Petersburg and brought up in Siberia and Ukraine, he joined Baron Wrangel's White Army in 1919 aged just sixteen, and fought in the Russian Civil War until the Army's evacuation from the Krimea in 1920. After a brief sojourn in Gallipoli and Contantinople (where he completed secondary school), he moved to Paris, where he spent eight years variously working as a docker, washing locomotives, and in the Citro�n factory. During periods of unemployment, he slept on park benches or in the M�tro. In 1928, he became a taxi driver, working nights, which enabled him to write and to attend lectures at the Sorbonne during the day. His first stories began appearing in 1926, in Russian �migr� periodicals, and he soon became part of the literary scene. In 1929 he published <i>An Evening with Claire</i>, which was acclaimed by, among others, Maxim Gorki and the great critic Vladislav Khodasevich. He died in Munich in 1971, and is buried in the Russian cemetery of Sainte-Genevi�ve-des-Bois near Paris.Of all my memories, of all my life&#x2019;s innumerable sensations, the most onerous was that of the single murder I had committed. Ever since the moment it happened, I cannot remember one day passing when I haven&#x2019;t regretted it. No punishment for it ever threatened me, because it occurred in the most exceptional of circumstances and it was clear that I couldn&#x2019;t have acted otherwise. Moreover, no one other than I knew about it. It was one of those countless episodes of the Civil War; in the general course of contemporary events it could be looked upon as an insignificant detail, all the more so as during those few minutes and seconds prior to the incident its outcome concerned only the two of us&#x2014;myself and another man, unknown to me. Then I was alone. No one else had any part in this.<br>I couldn&#x2019;t faithfully describe what led up to the event because everything was such a blur, a mark of almost all fighting in any war, the participants of which least of all conceive of what&#x2019;s happening in reality. It was summer, in southern Russia, and we were on our fourth day of continuous, disorderly troop manoeuvres, to an accompaniment of gunfire and sporadic fighting. I&#x2019;d completely lost all concept of time; I couldn&#x2019;t even say where I was exactly. I remember only the sensations, which could just as easily have been elicited in other circumstances&#x2014;the feeling of hunger, thirst, terrible fatigue; I hadn&#x2019;t slept these past two and a half nights. There was a torrid heat, and the air hung with the faint smell of smoke; an hour previously we&#x2019;d made our way out of a forest, which was ablaze on one side, and there, where the sunlight couldn&#x2019;t penetrate, a great straw-coloured shadow slowly pressed forward. I was so desperate for sleep; I remember thinking at the time that it would have been utter bliss to stop, lie down on the scorched grass and drop off, forgetting about everything. However, this was the one thing that I couldn&#x2019;t do, and so I continued through the hot, drowsy haze, swallowing my saliva and periodically rubbing my eyes, which were irritated by the heat and a lack of sleep. <br><br>I recall that when we were passing through a small grove, I leant against a tree and, standing for what I thought to be only a second, I drifted off with the long-familiar sound of gunfire in the background. When I opened my eyes there was no one around. I cut across the grove and set out on the road, in the direction I thought my comrades to have taken. Almost immediately I was outstripped by a Cossack astride a swift bay horse; he waved to me and shouted something I couldn&#x2019;t make out. After some time, I had the good fortune to come across a scraggy black mare whose rider obviously had been killed. She was bridled and had a Cossack saddle on her back, and she was nibbling at the grass, constantly swishing her long, wiry tail. As soon as I mounted her, she set off at a gallop. <br><br>I rode along a deserted winding road; every now and then the occasional little grove would obscure a bend in the track. The sun stood high in the sky, and the air almost hummed from the heat. Although I was riding quickly, I still have a false impression of everything happening in slow motion. I was still desperate for sleep; this longing filled my body and my consciousness, and because of it everything seemed lingering and drawn out, although in fact, of course, it couldn&#x2019;t have been so. The fighting had ceased; all was quiet. I saw no one either behind or ahead of me. Suddenly, at one of the turns veering off almost at a right angle, my horse fell hard, at full tilt. I went tumbling down with her, landing on a soft, dark&#x2014;because I closed my eyes&#x2014;patch, but managed to free my leg from the stirrup and escaped almost unharmed by the fall. The bullet had hit her right ear and passed straight through her head. Getting to my feet, I turned around and saw, not very far off, coming towards me at what seemed a slow, heavy gallop, a rider astride a great white horse. I recall that my rifle had been missing for quite some time; I&#x2019;d most probably left it in the grove where I fell asleep. I still had a revolver, though, and with some difficulty managed to pull it out of its tight, new holster. I stood for a few seconds, holding the revolver in my hand; it was so quiet that I could distinctly make out the dry sobbing of hooves against the cracked earth, the horse&#x2019;s heavy breathing, and another sound, similar to the rapid jingling of a little bunch of metallic rings. I saw the rider let go of the reins and shoulder his rifle, which, until that point, he had been carrying atilt. It was then that I fired. He jerked up in his saddle, slumped down and fell slowly to the ground. I stood motionless next to the body of my horse for two or three minutes. Still I wanted to sleep, and that same agonizing weariness persisted. I managed, however, to consider the fact that I had no idea what lay ahead of me or whether I would even be alive for much longer, but the irrepressible urge to see just whom I&#x2019;d killed compelled me to stir from my spot and approach him. No other distance, anywhere and at any time, has been as difficult for me to traverse as those fifty or sixty metres that separated me from the fallen rider; nevertheless, I walked towards him, dragging my feet over the hot cracked earth. Finally I reached him. He was a man of around twenty-two or twenty-three; his cap had blown off to one side, and his head, fair-haired, lay at an awkward angle on the dusty road. He was rather handsome. I leant over him and saw that he was dying; bubbles of pink foam frothed up and burst on his lips. He opened his dull eyes, said nothing, and closed them again. I stood over him and looked into his face, still clutching the now superfluous revolver with my numbing fingers. Suddenly, a light gust of warm air carried to me the scarcely audible clatter of horses&#x2019; hooves, and then I remembered the danger I could yet face. The dying man&#x2019;s white horse, pricking up its ears in alarm, stood only a few paces away from him. It was a great stallion, very well groomed and clean, its back a little dark with sweat. Of particular note were the horse&#x2019;s exceptional speed and endurance; I sold it a few days before I fled Russia, to a German settler who supplied me with an enormous quantity of provisions and paid me a vast sum of worthless money. The revolver I used to take the shot&#x2014;it was a wonderful Parabellum&#x2014;I cast into the sea, and from all this I was left with nothing more than a painful memory that haunted me everywhere Fate took me. However, the memory grew dimmer by and by, and with time it almost shed that initial feeling of constant, burning regret. But I was never able to forget it entirely. Many a time, whether it be summer or winter, by the sea or deep within the continent of Europe, I, mind empty, would close my eyes, and suddenly from the depths of memory that sultry day in southern Russia would draw once more into focus, and then those same feelings would re-emerge with all their former intensity. I saw again the enormous rose-grey shadow of the forest fire and its gradual progression amidst the crackle of burning twigs and branches; I felt that unforgettable, agonizing weariness and the almost overwhelming desire to sleep, the merciless brilliance of the sun, the ringing heat, and finally the mute recollection of the revolver&#x2019;s weight in my grasp, its rough grip as if for ever imprinted on my skin, the slight swaying of the black foresight in front of my right eye&#x2014;and then the fair-haired head on the grey, dusty road, and the face, transformed by the approach of death, that very death that I, only a second ago, had summoned out of the untold future.</p><h2>Sports Ethics: An Anthology</h2><p>The essays in this reader examine philosophical issues such as sportsmanship, violence, cheating, drug use, racism, sexism, and gender equity.<br> <ul> <li><br> </li> <li>Examines ethical issues in sports, such as sportsmanship, violence, cheating, drug use, racism, sexism, and gender equity.<br> </li> <li>Includes essays by psychologists, sociologists, coaches, and sports writers.<br> </li> <li>Gives the reader an understanding of the moral significance of sport, and how sports affect society.</li> </ul></p><p>The essays in this anthology examine philosophical issues such as sportsmanship, violence, cheating, drug use, racism, sexism, and gender equity.

John Howey, who practices architecture in the region, provides the first solid documentation of the Sarasota group's designs and theories. He has interviewed all of the surviving architects and original clients and has included a rich archive of photographs by Ezra Stoller, Alexandra Georges, and others whose views, particularly of the houses built between 1950 and 1960, gained world-wide exposure when they were first published forty years ago.</p><p>Howey first investigates the early influences on the Sarasota group, particularly of Frank Lloyd Wright in Florida. He then discusses such pivotal events as the opening of Ralph Twitchell's office in 1936 and the arrival of Paul Rudolph in 1941. Later chapters illustrate the effect of World War II on the Sarasota architects; early postwar successes of Twitchell and Rudolph; the influences of the Bauhaus and International Style; the tendency of various Sarasota architects to create their own design directions the arrival of Victor Lundy in 1954; the effect of changing economic, social, and political agendas on Sarasota's culture; and the philosophy and results of the Sarasota school.</p></p><p>The years: 1941 to 1966.

In <em>Letter to a Young Farmer,</em> his final book of essays, Logsdon addresses the next generation&#x2015;young people who are moving back to the land to enjoy a better way of life as small-scale &#x201c;garden farmers.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a lifestyle that isn&#x2019;t defined by accumulating wealth or by the &#x201c;get big or get out&#x201d; agribusiness mindset. Instead, it&#x2019;s one that recognizes the beauty of nature, cherishes the land, respects our fellow creatures, and values rural traditions. It&#x2019;s one that also looks forward and embraces &#x201c;right technologies,&#x201d; including new and innovative ways of working smarter, not harder, and avoiding premature burnout.</p> <p>Completed only a few weeks before the author&#x2019;s death, <em>Letter to a Young</em> <em>Farmer</em> is a remarkable testament to the life and wisdom of one of the greatest rural philosophers and writers of our time. Gene&#x2019;s earthy wit and sometimes irreverent humor combines with his valuable perspectives on many wide-ranging subjects&#x2015;everything from how to show a ram who&#x2019;s boss to enjoying the almost churchlike calmness of a well-built livestock barn.</p> <p>Reading this book is like sitting down on the porch with a neighbor who has learned the ways of farming through years of long observation and practice. Someone, in short, who has &#x201c;seen it all&#x201d; and has much to say, and much to teach us, if we only take the time to listen and learn. And Gene Logsdon was the best kind of teacher: equal parts storyteller, idealist, and rabble-rouser. His vision of a nation filled with garden farmers, based in cities, towns, and countrysides, will resonate with many people, both young and old, who long to create a more sustainable, meaningful life for themselves and a better world for all of us.</p></p><p><p>Over the course of his long life and career as a writer, farmer, and journalist, Gene Logsdon published more than two dozen books, both practical and philosophical, on all aspects of rural life and affairs. His nonfiction works include&nbsp;<em>Gene Everlasting, A Sanctuary of Trees,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Living at Nature&#x2019;s Pace.&nbsp;</em>He wrote a popular blog,&nbsp;<em>The Contrary Farmer,</em>&nbsp;as well as an award-winning column for the Carey, Ohio,&nbsp;<em>Progressor Times</em>. Gene was also a contributor to&nbsp;<em>Farming Magazine</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Draft Horse Journal.&nbsp;</em>He lived and farmed in Upper Sandusky, Ohio, where he died in 2016, a few weeks after finishing&nbsp;his final&nbsp;book,&nbsp;<em>Letter to a Young Farmer</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Kirkus Reviews-</strong></em></p> <p>&#x201c;An elegant, modern georgic in prose by &#x2018;contrary farmer&#x2019; Logsdon (<em>Gene Everlasting</em>, 2013, etc.). Of a piece with the works of Wendell Berry, Wes Jackson, and other modern back-to-the-landers, Logsdon&#x2019;s last book (he died in May 2016) comprises a set of essays addressed to an imagined young person contemplating a life in the fields. &#x2018;There&#x2019;s no such thing as&nbsp;<em>the&nbsp;</em>American farmer,&#x2019; counsels the author at the outset. Instead, there are beet farmers, dairy farmers, flower farmers, marijuana farmers, and even &#x2018;moonshine farmers,&#x2019; which makes it difficult to categorize all the different kinds of farmers and to subsume them into any meaningful political organization. The point is that because there is so much diversity in farming, anyone with intelligence, gumption, and stick-to-itiveness shouldn&#x2019;t be dissuaded from having a go at it. Of course, there are plenty of reasons not to farm, and Logsdon isn&#x2019;t shy of enumerating the challenges, from the fiscal and physical ones to matters that embrace even the heart: one of his essays concerns how to find a suitable helpmeet out in the sticks, where, as a former seminarian, he discovered &#x2018;there were girls peeking out from behind every crossroads stop sign in the county.&#x2019; Times change, but the struggle continues, one aspect of it the corporatization of farming. Oddly, there Logsdon finds an ally in the chain restaurateur Bob Evans, who encouraged those who would listen to invest in biological over mechanical solutions, saying, &#x2018;tractors don&#x2019;t have babies.&#x2019; Logsdon is encouraging without being Pollyannaish, homespun while also sometimes arch: &#x2018;On the occasions when I have had to travel in city traffic, the thought always occurs to me that people who must commute into cities to work spend about as much time just waiting for traffic lights to change as it takes me to write a book.&#x2019; From raising cattle to organizing markets, there&#x2019;s much value here for every aspiring farmer, whose work requires brains along with brawn.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Foreword Reviews</em>-</strong></p> <p>"This engaging, conversational book dispenses life advice for farmers and others who seek to live close to the earth.&nbsp;<em>Letter to a Young Farmer&nbsp;</em>is an accumulation of wisdom with a large dollop of humor and a conversational tone that will endear it to almost every audience. The book recalls a conversation with a parent or older family member in that many of its common-sense directives are informed by experience, from the purchasing of land to the management of aggressive rams. But not all the advice here is specific to farmers or 'garden farmers'; general life advice can be extrapolated from discussions of love, finance, and other common-sense aspects of life.&nbsp;Categorizing&nbsp;<em>Letter&nbsp;</em>is tricky at times, perhaps appropriately so, stating that 'contrary farmers,' as the author self-identifies, tend to defy stereotyping. It is philosophical, but it also dispenses concrete advice. Likewise, though it does present useful information, much of this is apocryphal, cast in a slyly humorous way, and even opinionated. For example, the author agrees that climate change is a problem, but he also describes people concerned over the issue as paranoid 'hand-wringers.&#x2019;&nbsp;<em>Letter&nbsp;</em>is best read as an inspirational piece. It seems likely to lure many a gardening neophyte to the farm life, though it takes care to stress the difficulty of this path too. Above all, it preaches consistency, locality, and the long view, occasionally contrasting this philosophy with the frantic pace of mainstream modern life. In the book&#x2019;s worldview, small farming is the key to solving the most serious of our environmental, mental, and physical problems as well as the existential emptiness of consumerism. Yet at the same time, it does not advocate complete abandonment of capitalist modality. Parts of the book recall Buddhist principles of moderation.&nbsp;With its unique point of view,&nbsp;<em>Letter to a Young Farmer&nbsp;</em>is a must-read piece of environmental, agricultural, and social philosophy.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Booklist</em>-</strong></p> <p>If Logsdon (1932-2016) had his way, the term&nbsp;<em>contrary farmer</em>&nbsp;would have been every bit as familiar as <em>country farmer</em>. A learned proponent of &#x2018;stay in and stay small' garden farming, Logsdon&#x2019;s outspoken outlook was completely in opposition to the practices and philosophies of corporate agribusiness. Instead of encouraging farmers to 'go big or get out' by adding more property, more machinery, and more debt, Logsdon championed the idea of working on a more personal scale that allows farmers to appreciate nature and honor tradition while still accepting technology and innovation. In this posthumously published book of essays, Logsdon extols the virtues of finding a good mate, praises the pluck and professionalism of women farmers, and enthuses about the health benefits of a day in the barn. Along with other hard-earned advice about hauling livestock, pasturing chickens, and controlling weeds, Logsdon&#x2019;s lifetime of farming wisdom is firmly lodged in common sense. Sagacious and sly, practical and poetic, Logsdon&#x2019;s voice may have been contrarian but it was never condescending.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;In the midst of our epidemic fear of the future and its so-far predicted emergencies and catastrophes, here is Gene patiently, quietly, with the right touch of merriment, talking about the small, really possible ways of solving our one great problem: how to live on the Earth without destroying it.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Wendell Berry, from the foreword</strong></p><br><br><p><em><strong>Publishers Weekly-</strong> <br> </em></p> <p>Late Ohioan farmer Logsdon (<em>Gene Everlasting: A Contrary Farmer&#x2019;s Thoughts on Living Forever</em>) sends a meaningful (though poorly titled) message to up-and-coming homestead farmers. Written during the late stages of an illness that would take the author&#x2019;s life in 2016, the book stands as his final assertion and rallying cry against the misguided notion, so prevalent at one time, that farmers needed to 'get big or get out.' The book isn&#x2019;t written in the intimate style of a personal missive as the title suggests; it&#x2019;s more of an essay collection squarely addressing topics such as small-scale economics, pasture farming, raising sheep, and the 'modern plowgirl,' with practical-minded advice throughout. This work serves as a guiding light and lodestar for farmers facing the modern challenges of any farming operation, large or small.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit (Cliffs Notes)</h2><p>Join the journey through Middle-earth in the study guide of these two epic fantasies suggestive of life in medieval days, a classical battle between good and evil and the quest for a magical ring.

Written for students who have completed an introductory course in biology, it provides an in-depth treatment of both the biology of insects and their classification, including keys for identification for over four hundred families. The common insects of North America are discussed as well as species found elsewhere in the world. <br> Parts I and II provide reading material for lectures: Part I: Insects as Organisms, covers morphology, physiology, and behavior, including social behavior. Part II: Insect Ecology, begins with population biology and includes chapters on insects in relation to their environments and pest management. Part III, Insect Diversity, provides source material for the laboratory. The classification of insects, their evolution, and fossil record are discussed first, followed by coverage of each order in terms of general biology and ecology, keys for identification of families, and, in some chapters, discussion of the biologies of families. All insect orders and over four hundred families of insects are treated. <br> This second edition features new chapters on population biology, insects and microbes, pest management, and methods for making an insect collection. It is illustrated with new line drawings by Barbara Boole Daly and many new photographs, including 48 in color, by Edward S. Ross. A unique feature in a text of this kind, these color photographs allow students to witness a variety of life forms and habits that they normally would not have the opportunity to observe in nature.</p><p>Alexander H.

He is the author of more than twenty works of fiction and nonfiction, including <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain</i>, <i>Notes of a Native Son</i>, <i>Giovanni's Room</i>, <i>Nobody Knows My Name</i>, <i>Another Country</i>, and <i>The Fire Next Time</i>. Among the awards he received are a Eugene F. Saxon Memorial Trust Award, a Rosenwald Fellowship, a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Partisan Review Fellowship, and a Ford Foundation grant. He was made a Commander of the Legion of Honor in 1986. Baldwin died in 1987.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>"That is a good idea," I heard my mother say. She was staring at a wad of black velvet, which she held in her hand, and she carefully placed this bit of cloth in a closet. We can guess how old I must have been from the fact that for years afterward I thought that an "idea" was a piece of black velvet.<br><br>Much, much, much has been blotted out, coming back only lately in bewildering and untrustworthy flashes. I must have been about five, I should think, when I made my connection between ideas and velvet, but I may have been younger; this may have been the same year that my father had me circumcised, a terrifying event which I scarcely remember at all; or I may think I was five because I remember tugging at my mother's skirts once and watching her face while she was telling someone else that she was twenty-seven. This meant, for me, that she was virtually in the grave already, and I tugged a little harder at her skirts. I already knew, for some reason, or had given myself some reason to believe, that she had been twenty-two when I was born. And, though I can't count today, I could count when I was little.<br><br>I was the only child in the house--or houses--for a while, a halcyon period which memory has quite repudiated; and if I remember myself as tugging at my mother's skirts and staring up into her face, it was because I was so terrified of the man we called my father; who did not arrive on my scene, really, until I was more than two years old. I have written both too much and too little about this man, whom I did not understand till he was past Understanding. in my first memory of him, he is standing in the kitchen, drying the dishes. My mother had dressed me to go out, she is taking me someplace, and it must be winter, because I am wearing, in my memory, one of those cloth hats with a kind of visor, which button under the chin--a Lindbergh hat, I think. I am apparently in my mother's arms, for I am staring at my father over my mother's shoulder, we are near the door; and my father smiles. This may be a memory, I think it is, but it may be a fantasy. One of the very last times I saw my father on his feet, I was staring at him over my mother's shoulder--she had come rushing into the room to separate us--and mx father was not smiling and neither was I.<br><br>His mother, Barbara, lived in our house, and she had been born in slavery. She was so old that she never moved from her bed. I remember her as pale and gaunt and she must have worn a kerchief because I don't remember her hair. I remember that she loved me: she used to scold her son about the way he treated me; and he was a little afraid of her. When she died, she called me into the room to give me a present--one of those old, round, metal boxes, usually with a floral design, used for candy. She thought it was full of candy and I thought it was full of candy, but it wasn't. After she died, I opened it and it was full of needles and thread.<br><br>This broke my heart, of course, but her going broke it more because I had loved her and depended on her. I knew--children must know--that she would always protect me with all her strength. So would my mother, too, I knew that, but my mother's strength was only to be called on in a desperate emergency. It did not take me long, nor did the children, as they came tumbling into this world, take long to discover that our mother paid an immense price for standing between us and our father. He had ways of making her suffer quite beyond our ken, and so we soon learned to depend on each other and became a kind of wordless conspiracy to protect her. (We were all, absolutely and mercilessly, united against our father.) We soon realized, anyway, that she scarcely belonged to us: she was always in the hospital, having another baby. Between his merciless children, who were terrified of him, the pregnancies, the births, the rats, the murders on Lenox Avenue, the whores who lived downstairs, his job on Long Island--to which he went every morning, wearing a Derby or a Homburg, in a black suit, white shirt, dark tie, looking like the preacher he was, and with his black lunch-box in his hand--and his unreciprocated love for the Great God Almighty, it is no wonder our father went mad. We, on the other hand, luckily, on the whole, for our father, and luckily indeed for our mother, simply took over each new child and made it ours. I want to avoid generalities as far as possible; it will, I hope, become clear presently that what I am now attempting dictates this avoidance; and so I will not say that children love miracles, but I will say that I think we did. A newborn baby is an extraordinary event; and I have never seen two babies who looked or even sounded remotely alike. Here it is, this breathing mirade who could not live an instant without you, with a skull more fragile than an egg, a miracle of eyes, legs, toenails, and (especially) lungs. It gropes in the light like a blind thing--it is, for the moment, blind--what can it make of what it sees? It's got a little hair, which it's going to lose, it's got no teeth, it pees all over you, it belches, and when it's frightened or hungry, quite without knowing what a miracle it's accomplishing, it exercises its lungs. You watch it discover it has a hand; then it discovers it has toes. Presently, it discovers it has you, and since it has already decided it wants to live, it gives you a toothless smile when you come near it, gurgles or giggles when you pick it up, holds you tight by the thumb or the eyeball or the hair, and, having already opted against solitude, howls when you put it down. You begin the extraordinary journey of beginning to know and to control this creature. You know the sound--the meaning--of one cry from another; without knowing that you know it. You know when it's hungry--that's one sound. You know when it's wet--that's another sound. You know when it's angry. You know when it's bored. You know when it's frightened. You know when it's suffering. You come or you go or you sit still according to the sound the baby makes. And you watch over it where I was born, even in your sleep, because rats love the odor of newborn babies and are much, much bigger.<br><br>By the time it has managed to crawl under every bed, nearly suffocate itself in every drawer, nearly strangle itself with string, somehow, God knows how, trapped itself behind the radiator, been pulled back, by one leg, from its suicidal investigation of the staircase, and nearly poisoned itself with everything--its hand being quicker than your eye--it can possibly get into its mouth, you have either grown to love it or you have left home.<br><br>I, James, in August. George, in January. Barbara, in August. Wilmer, in October, David, in December. Gloria, Ruth, Elizabeth, and (when we thought it was over!) Paula Maria, named by me, born on the day our father died, all in the summertime.<br>The youngest son of the New Orleans branch of the family--family, here, is used loosely and has to be; we knew almost nothing about this branch, which knew nothing about us; Daddy, the great good friend of the Great God Almighty, had simply fled the South, leaving a branch behind. As I have said, he was the son of a slave, and his youngest daughter, by his first marriage, is my mother's age and his youngest son is nine years older than I. This boy, who did not get along with his father, was my elder brother, as far as I then knew, and he sometimes took me with him here and there. He took me into the Coney Island breakers on his back one day, teaching me to swim, and somehow ducked beneath me, playing, or was carried away from me for a moment, terrified, caught me and brought me above the waves. In the time that his body vanished beneath me and the waters rolled over my head, I still remember the slimy sea water and the blinding green--it was not green; it was all the world's snot and vomit; it entered into me; when my head was abruptly lifted out of the water, when I felt my brother's arms and saw his worried face--his eyes looking steadily into mine with the intense and yet impersonal anxiety of a surgeon, the sky above me not yet in focus, my lungs failing to deliver the mighty scream I had nearly burst with in the depths, my four or five or six-year-old legs kicking--and my brother slung me over his shoulder like a piece of meat, or a much beloved child, and strode up out of the sea with me, with me! he had saved me, after all, I learned something about the terror and the loneliness and the depth and the height of love.<br><br>Not so very much later, this brother, who was in his teens, fooling around with girls or shooting dice with his friends, who knows, came home late, which was forbidden in our Baptist house, and had a terrible fight with his Daddy and left the house and never came back. He swore that he never would come back, that his Daddy would never see him again. And he never did come back, not while daddy was still alive. Daddy wrote, but his son never answered. When I became a young minister, I was asked to write him, and I did-- sometimes my father dictated the letters to me. And the boy answered me, sometimes, but he never answered his father and never mentioned him. Daddy slowly began to realize that he was never going to see that son, who was his darling, the apple of his eye, anymore, and this broke his heart and destroyed his will and helped him into the madhouse and the grave--my only intimation, perhaps, during all those years, that he was human. The son came home, when his father died, to help me bury him. Then he went away again, and I didn't see him until I had to go to California on a Civil Rights gig, and he met me at the airport. By then, I was thirty-nine and he was nearly fifty, I had made his disowned father's name famous, and I had left home in exactly the same way he did, for more or less the same reasons, and when I was seventeen.<br>Since Martin's death, in Memphis, and that tremendous day in Atlanta, something has altered in me, something has gone away. Perhaps even more than the death itself, the manner of his death has forced me into a judgment concerning human life and human beings which I hav...</p><h2>Emily Carr and Her Dogs: Flirt, Punk, and Loo</h2><p>This delightful book combines 25 stories about dogs with 16 playful drawings by famous Canadian writer, artist, and animal lover Emily Carr. She tells of her joys and tribulations raising Old English sheepdogs, from her decision to start a kennel to the sad day when she had to close it. With each story Carr brings the affectionate and loyal nature of her canine companions to life, making this book an ideal choice for any dog lover, child, or adult.</p><p>Young, spirited and rebellious, <strong>Emily Carr</strong> escaped a strict Victorian household to study art in the Paris of Picasso and Matisse. In middle age, she shook the dust of acceptable society from her shoes and began a passionate journey into the wilderness of British Columbia; the power of her genius made her one of the twentieth century's great painters. Fortunately, she also wrote. In her books, her warmth, her humanity, her sense of fun and the ridiculous combine to present a self-portrait of a remarkable woman and artist. -- Mary Pratt</p><h2>The Art of Fugue: Bach Fugues for Keyboard, 1715-1750</h2><p>Fugue for J. S. Bach was a natural language; he wrote fugues in organ toccatas and voluntaries, in masses and motets, in orchestral and chamber music, and even in his sonatas for violin solo. The more intimate fugues he wrote for keyboard are among the greatest, most influential, and best-loved works in all of Western music. They have long been the foundation of the keyboard repertory, played by beginning students and world-famous virtuosi alike. In a series of elegantly written essays, eminent musicologist Joseph Kerman discusses his favorite Bach keyboard fugues&#x2014;some of them among the best-known fugues and others much less familiar. Kerman skillfully, at times playfully, reveals the inner workings of these pieces, linking the form of the fugues with their many different characters and expressive qualities, and illuminating what makes them particularly beautiful, powerful, and moving.<br><br>These witty, insightful pieces, addressed to musical amateurs as well as to specialists and students, are beautifully augmented by a CD with new performances made specially for this volume. In addition to the complete scores for all the music discussed in the book, the CD features Karen Rosenak, piano, playing two preludes and fugues from <i>TheWell-Tempered Clavier</i>&#x2014;C Major, book 1; and B Major, book 2&#x2014;and recordings by Davitt Moroney of the Fughetta in C Major, BWV 952, on clavichord; the Fugue on "Jesus Christus unser Heiland," BWV 689, on organ; and the Fantasy and Fugue in A Minor, BWV 904, on harpsichord.</p><p>It is sweet and fitting that Joseph Kerman, who has given us such insight into William Byrd, one of music's inspiring octogenarians, should have celebrated his own eightieth birthday by completing this rich and constantly surprising study of Bach&#x2019;s fugues. As ever, Kerman's hearing is sharp, his thinking precise and original, and his prose elegant and sapid. Who would have thought that one could write about fugues with such warmth and love, and with such an exhilarating sense of joy?&#x201d; Michael Steinberg, author of <i>The Symphony: A Listener&#x2019;s Guide</i><br><br>"Joseph Kerman's writings on Bach are astonishing, stimulating. . . they help the musician and listener to encounter the sometimes impenetrable music of Bach in a way which is marvelous and accessible."

Its new advocates have become more sophisticated in how they present their views, speaking of "intelligent design" rather than "creation science" and aiming their arguments against the naturalistic philosophical method that underlies science, proposing to replace it with a "theistic science." The creationism controversy is not just about the status of Darwinian evolution--it is a clash of religious and philosophical worldviews, for a common underlying fear among Creationists is that evolution undermines both the basis of morality as they understand it and the possibility of purpose in life.In Tower of Babel, philosopher Robert T. Pennock compares the views of the new creationists with those of the old and reveals the insubstantiality of their arguments. One of Pennock's major innovations is to turn from biological evolution to the less charged subject of linguistic evolution, which has strong theoretical parallels with biological evolution, both in content and in the sort of evidence scientists use to draw conclusions about origins. Of course, an evolutionary view of language does conflict with the Bible, which says that God created the variety of languages at one time as punishment for the Tower of Babel.Several chapters deal with the work of Phillip Johnson, a highly influential leader of the new Creationists. Against his and other views, Pennock explains how science uses naturalism and discusses the relationship between factual and moral issues in the creationism-evolution controversy. The book also includes a discussion of Darwin's own shift from creationist to evolutionist and an extended argument for keeping private religious beliefs separate from public scientific knowledge.</p></p><p>The face of creationism has been through some major plastic surgery in the past decade or so. The leading proponents of "intelligent design theory" have left the ranting flat-earth types behind and found respected positions in the academic world from which to launch attacks on mainstream science. Philosopher of science Robert T. Pennock has explored all sides of the ongoing debate, which remains (despite the protestations of many creationists) more about biblical inerrancy than scientific evidence. His book <i>Tower of Babel</i> examines the new directions antievolutionists have taken lately, but goes beyond a mere recounting of recent history by proposing a new avenue of counterattack: linguistics.<p> The parallels are striking once we look closely: Genesis proclaims that God created all human languages at one stroke, while modern scientific thought proposes linguistic evolution similar in form to genetics. Best of all for scientists, though, linguistic change is much more rapid than biological change, and we have actually observed what might be called "speciation events" to have occurred historically in languages. While not meant to supplant traditional arguments against creationism, Pennock's ideas certainly supplement them and will be useful to educators and researchers alike. His sense of urgency is compelling; he sees the future of scientific education and freedom at stake and argues strongly for a separation between private beliefs and public knowledge. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><p>Robert T.

The speech began what Cass R. Sunstein calls the Second American Revolution by giving form and specificity, for the first time, to the concept of human economic rights. Many of the great legislative achievements of the past sixty years stem from Roosevelt&#39;s proposal for a Second Bill of Rights. Yet these rights have never been written into the Constitution, and they remain the subject of passionate debate. In recent years they have even lost ground.Using FDR&#39;s speech as a launching point, Sunstein examines the &#34;legal realist&#34; school of thought, which decisively refuted the idea of laissez-faire economics; describes how Roosevelt gradually developed the idea of a Second Bill of Rights; and asks why the Second Bill, which was almost enacted under the Warren Court, has never attained the constitutional status FDR sought for it. The reason, Sunstein maintains, is not anything unique to American culture or temperament but a particular historical accident: the election of Richard Nixon as President in 1968.This is an ambitious, sweeping book that argues for a new vision of FDR, of constitutional history, and of our current political scene. The Second Bill of Rights is an integral part of the American tradition and the starting point for contemporary political reform.</p><p><b>Cass R. Sunstein</b> is Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Jurisprudence at the University of Chicago Law School and a contributing editor at <i>The New Republic</i> and the <i>American Prospect</i> . He has testified before Congress on numerous occasions and has contributed as well to such publications as the <i>New York Times</i> , the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> , and the <i>Washington Post</i> . His numerous books include <i>Republic.com</i> , <i>Risk and Reason</i> , <i>Laws of Fear</i> , and <i>The Second Bill of Rights</i> . He lives in Chicago, Illinois.While it doesn't succeed in making Franklin Roosevelt into a constitutional innovator, this disheveled book does bring into focus FDR's forgotten effort to address domestic "security," as WWII neared its climax. Roosevelt's inaugural address of January 11, 1944, asked Congress to adopt a "second Bill of Rights": guarantees of work, adequate housing and income, medical care and education, among others&#x2014;promises designed to extend the New Deal (and thwart the appeal of communism). The indefatigable Sunstein (<i>Why Societies Need Dissent</i>, etc.) sketches Roosevelt's domestic policies and the logistics of the inaugural address (included in full in an appendix), then debates the never-adopted bill's merits, historically as its ideas kicked around in the post WWII-era, and as it might be taken up today. He tends to be scanty on the bill's potential budgetary toll and on the responsibility for one's own welfare that FDR thought the bill's beneficiaries ought to bear. Sunstein roams widely over legal history and precedent, but is focused and clear in showing how FDR sowed the seeds of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (in whose 1948 drafting Eleanor Roosevelt played a crucial role) and energetic in discussing this proposal's further possible legacy. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They address many of my concerns with existing texts by providing instructors with a great deal of leeway in designing a syllabus. Each case study is written by a prominent scholar or rising comparativist and is nicely linked to the thematic survey. This would allow me the flexibility of using a different survey text or no survey text at all.&#x201d;&#x2014;Emmanuel Teitelbaum, George Washington University</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;I have looked at many comparative politics textbooks and none of them have appealed to me the way that this one did right away. Some aim too high and ask far too much of students, losing them in a sea of concepts with few tools to make sense of them. Others aim too low and ask far too little of students, failing to challenge them on the essential themes and concepts of comparative politics. This one finds the middle ground by presenting topics in an interesting and engaging manner and challenging students to cultivate their analytical skills.&#x201d;&#x2014;Katy Crossley-Frolick, Denison University</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;David Samuels helps students make sense of complex theoretical questions and approaches, and he applies them very effectively to case examples. This textbook beats all the alternatives; it is very well thought-out.&#x201d;&#x2014;Kenneth Roberts, Cornell University</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Samuels engages professors as well as students by making our field accessible without compromising the curiosities and complexities that make it so interesting. The study of institutions, interests, and identities introduces undergraduates to the politics of countries in the world through a rigorous lens of comparative analysis. Samuels raises the most interesting questions and puzzles within our field and guides the student through the methods of comparative politics science. To have a textbook that moves beyond a list of concepts and an historical chronology of countries is immensely satisfying.&#x201d;&#x2014;Lauretta Frederking, University of Portland</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;I am delighted that the author recognizes how graduate-level comparative political scientists are trained and that he has brought this approach to the undergraduate level. This is useful training not only for budding comparative politics students but for those who seek to become informed world citizens.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jennifer White, University of Georgia</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;<i>Comparative Politics</i> is a theory-centered introductory text that perfectly balances the substantive nature of our field with the level of accessibility necessary for an undergraduate class.&#x201d;&#x2014;Julie Mazzei, Kent State University</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;David Samuels provides a strong introduction to the themes, concepts, and current debates of comparative politics without burying the reader in a mound of empirical details. It encourages hypothesis testing, fosters students&#x2019; critical thinking skills, and encourages students to place current political developments in context.&#x201d;&#x2014;John Scherpereel, James Madison University</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;I am impressed that Samuels does not shy away from introducing students to the major debates in comparative politics and having them evaluate competing arguments. In trying to get the students to think theoretically, he has definitely chosen an approach that will challenge the best students.&#x201d;&#x2014;Steve Barracca, Eastern Kentucky University</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;This is a readable and well-organized exploration of major topics in comparative politics that brings together basic as well as more advanced topics. It provides students with examples of how to actually do comparative politics and prompts them to think through the major arguments of the field.&#x201d;&#x2014;Wendy N. Whitman Cobb, Santa Fe College</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;David Samuels does a better job than any I have seen of discussing key themes in comparative politics in an intelligent and well-written way. He raises the big questions in a straightforward and engaged manner, and he does a good job of addressing them in comparative perspective with the American institutions that my students know well.&#x201d;&#x2014;Kevin Deegan-Krause, Wayne State University</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Samuels offers students a theoretically robust yet highly accessible introduction to the study of comparative politics. He clearly introduces core concepts and theories, offering compelling examples that encourage students to think through different ways of answering fundamental questions that define the field. I&#x2019;m thrilled to see the strong focus on political identity in an introductory textbook.&#x201d;&#x2014;James Ross, University of Northern Colorado</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;This work is thoughtfully and freshly conceived and focuses on a straightforward analysis of political outcomes instead of rehashing historical debates in comparative politics that are not germane to students just coming to the topic. David Samuels writes with an enthusiasm that will entice students, and his emphasis on comparative politics as a puzzle is something that I would like my students to assimilate.&#x201d;&#x2014;David Levenbach, Arkansas State University</p> <p> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;David Samuel&#x2019;s innovative thematic survey and country casebook stand out as the most comprehensive material for introductory comparative politics courses. Throughout both, he successfully weaves the themes of institutions, identity and interests and demonstrates how these impact social, economic and political outcomes in different countries.&#x201d;&#x2013;Dauda Abubakar, University of Michigan&#x2013;Flint</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>&#x201c;I have been teaching introductory comparative politics for over four years now, and I have examined some fifteen textbooks for this class.

This edition features a new Introduction by Penelope Fitzgerald which examines the pleasure given by <em>Emma</em>'s reassuringly stable world as well as by its comedy, and examines the relationships, imagery, and continuing power of Austen's last and perhaps greatest novel.</p><p>Of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is the most flawed, the most infuriating, and, in the end, the most endearing. <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>'s Lizzie Bennet has more wit and sparkle; Catherine Morland in <i> Northanger Abbey</i> more imagination; and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>'s Elinor Dashwood certainly more sense--but Emma is lovable precisely because she is so imperfect. Austen only completed six novels in her lifetime, of which five feature young women whose chances for making a good marriage depend greatly on financial issues, and whose prospects if they fail are rather grim. <i>Emma</i> is the exception: "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." One may be tempted to wonder what Austen could possibly find to say about so fortunate a character. The answer is, quite a lot. <p> For Emma, raised to think well of herself, has <i>such</i> a high opinion of her own worth that it blinds her to the opinions of others. The story revolves around a comedy of errors: Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, and attempts to remake her in her own image. Ignoring the gaping difference in their respective fortunes and stations in life, Emma convinces herself and her friend that Harriet should look as high as Emma herself might for a husband--and she zeroes in on an ambitious vicar as the perfect match. At the same time, she reads too much into a flirtation with Frank Churchill, the newly arrived son of family friends, <i>and</i> thoughtlessly starts a rumor about poor but beautiful Jane Fairfax, the beloved niece of two genteelly impoverished elderly ladies in the village. As Emma's fantastically misguided schemes threaten to surge out of control, the voice of reason is provided by Mr. Knightly, the Woodhouse's longtime friend and neighbor. Though Austen herself described Emma as "a heroine whom no one but myself will much like," she endowed her creation with enough charm to see her through her most egregious behavior, and the saving grace of being able to learn from her mistakes. By the end of the novel Harriet, Frank, and Jane are all properly accounted for, Emma is wiser (though certainly not sadder), and the reader has had the satisfaction of enjoying Jane Austen at the height of her powers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Emma is Austen&#39;s most technically accomplished novel, with a hidden plot, the full implications of which are only revealed by a second reading. The text presented here retains the spelling and punctuation of the first edition of 1816, allowing readers to see the novel as Austen&#39;s contemporaries first encountered it. The volume provides comprehensive explanatory notes, an extensive critical introduction, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual apparatus. This edition is an indispensable resource for all scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>The Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic (Volume 6) (The Civilization of the American Indian Series)</h2><p><p>Here is the story of the Choctaws, a proud and gifted tribe among the Five Civilized Tribes of Indians. It is the record of a people whose forced migration from their ancestral homes in the South to what is now Oklahoma and whose subsequent efforts from the Civil War to the close of the century to maintain an autonomous government and institutions form a distinctive and arresting chapter in the history of the West.</p> <p>While the political, social, and economic customs of the Choctaws were closely circumscribed, the thread of Choctaw history was at all times closely interwoven witht he larger fabric of American history as a whole. Choctaw law was a curious combination of ancient tribal custom and Anglo-American legal practice; Choctaw churches and schools were copied almost wholly from the white man&#x2019;s society; and Choctaw economic institutions represented an attempt to adjust the customs of tribal control of the land to the white system of individual ownership.</p></p><p><p><strong>Angie Debo</strong> was reared in a pioneer community, at Marshall, Oklahoma, where it has been her privilege to know from childhood the folkways of the Indians and the traditions of the western settlers. A member of her community high school's first graduating class, she later attended the University of Oklahoma, where she was a Phi Beta Kappa, and took her B.A. and later her Ph.D. degree; she received her master's degree from the University of Chicago. Her education was combined with intervals of teaching in country schools, starting at the age of sixteen.</p> <p>Miss Debo's distinguished reputation as a regional scholar has been enhanced by her book, <em>The Rise and. Fall of the Choctaw Republic, </em>which won the John H. Dunning prize of the American Historical Society for the best book submitted in the field of United States history in 1934, and for her later, book, <em>And Still the Waters Run. </em>She has been a teacher in schools and colleges both in Oklahoma and Texas and was curator of the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum in Canyon, Texas.

Spanning 2,500 years of ethical theory, the first part, <strong>Historical Sources,</strong> ranges from ancient Greece to the twentieth century. It moves from classical thought through medieval views to modern theories, culminating with leading nineteenth- and twentieth-century thinkers. The second part, <strong>Modern Ethical Theory,</strong> includes many of the most important essays of the past century. The discussion of utilitarianism, Kantianism, egoism, and relativism continues in the work of major contemporary philosophers, while landmark selections reflect concern with moral language and the justification of morality. The concepts of duty, justice, and rights are explored, as well as recent views on cultural relativism and an ethic influenced by feminist concerns. In the third part, <strong>Contemporary Moral Problems,</strong> the readings present the current debates over abortion, euthanasia, famine relief, animal rights, environmentalism, and the use of torture in interrogations, as well as essays on death and the meaning of life. Wherever possible, each reading is printed in its entirety.<br><br>The fifth edition features new readings from Cicero, Barbara Herman, and Judith Jarvis Thomson; an expanded selection from Joseph Butler's Fifteen Sermons; and a new translation of Kant's Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals.</p><p><br><strong>Steven M.

His observations push the boundaries of cultural criticism to establish a vantage point from which the seemingly disparate agendas of artists, patrons, and critics have a telling coherence. The Anti-Aesthetic is a touchstone volume for postmodern debate and theory. Though the cultural stakes and terms have changed over the last decade, this collection still illuminates--perhaps now even more lucidly--a vital current in contemporary criticism.

She lives in Providence, Rhode Island.BODY OF WORK is Christine Montrosss memoir of her first year in medical school, during which she studied human anatomy with the help of Eve an elderly woman who donated her remains for that purpose. Thoroughly and methodically dissecting a human cadaver is an experience that includes equal parts revulsion, fascination, empathy, and indifference. Rene Raudman touches on each of these in all the appropriate places, and with just the right level of emotion. Her tone, like Montrosss writing, is often irreverent and dryly funny, without ever being disrespectful. The author interview at the end gives an added glimpse into the anatomy lab.

It emphasizes generic programming and using the C++ Standard Library.</p><p>Aimed at advanced C++ developers who want to hone their programming chops even further, Herb Sutter's <i>More Exceptional C++</i> borrows the format of his earlier title, <i>Exceptional C++</i>, and delivers some of today's best-available thinking on the language in a handy and effective format. A compilation of the author's own experience and research on the thornier aspects of C++, this book will serve as a worthy resource for making sure you get the most out of this powerful language.<p> The concise text covers a range of challenging topics in C++ without attempting to be comprehensive. Each "item" is presented as a question to try and solve yourself before the author presents his solution, plus additional detail as needed. For most topics, Sutter ends by giving his advice on the best practices (and gotchas to avoid).</p><p> Early sections concentrate on using Standard Template Library (STL) container classes, like removing items effectively, and the subtle differences between container types. Standout sections on designing custom templates (using specialization techniques) and exception-safe classes will help you do more with your own classes. One entertaining problem here shows a number-guessing game (Mastermind) built as efficiently as possible using STL code (including expert-level use of generic functions to do much of the work).</p><p> Several problems on copy-on-write (COW) semantics for more efficient classes point out the issues surrounding code optimization. (The author argues against a simplistic approach to optimizing code, including an overreliance on <i>inlining</i> functions. Several times he points out the difficulty of getting COW code to work in multithreaded projects.)</p><p> There has been a debate in the C++ community for years about whether it's possible to design truly "exception-safe" classes. Sutter points out the difficulty with a precise analysis of the issues surrounding exceptions and C++ constructors. Material on the finer points of inheriting classes (including when to avoid and when to use multiple inheritance in C++) will extend your class design options. A good section here is the author's explication of how to simulate COM/Java style interfaces in C++, which isn't immediately obvious, even to experienced C++ developers.</p><p> Later sections delve into code maintenance issues, including advice for using macros, <i>typedefs</i>, and namespaces. (Advice on migrating existing C++ code into namespaces will help you combine legacy code with other libraries.) A final appendix shows off some benchmarks for optimizing strings using a variety of techniques.</p><p> Intelligent, provocative, and demanding, <i>More Exceptional C++</i> shows why C++ continues to be a rich, complex, and challenging language. Armed with titles like this one, experienced C++ programmers can write better code and avoid pitfalls buried in the outer edges of their favorite language. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered:</b> Puzzles and solutions to advanced topics in C++, using <i>remove()</i> and <i>erase()</i> for Standard Template Library (STL) containers, custom templates with inheritance and traits, using <i>typename</i>, containers used with pointers, the finer points of <i>vector</i>, <i>set</i>, and <i>maps</i>, potential problems with <i>vector &lt; bool &gt;</i>, post and prefix operators used with functions, templates overloading, explicit and partial template specialization (plus function template overloading), using STL to implement Mastermind (a number-guessing game), the finer points of <i>inline</i> functions, lazy optimizations (including copy-on-write--COW--and semantics for strings), iterators and references, gotchas in multithreaded environments, designing exception-safe classes, constructor failures and object lifetimes, uncaught exceptions (the pitfalls of using <i>uncaught_exception()</i>), unmanaged pointers (in parameter evaluation and <i>auto_ptr</i>); copy assignment, inheritance and exception safety issues, multiple inheritance dos and don'ts, the Siamese Twin problem, virtual functions, controlled polymorphism, memory management issues with smart pointers (<i>auto_ptr</i>), recursive declarations, how to simulate nested functions, preprocessor macros, hints for initialization, forward declarations, using <i>typedef</i> effectively, best practices for namespaces (including code maintenance and migrating existing C++ code to namespaces), and appendices on advice for multithreaded optimization.</p><p>Organized in a practical problem-and-solution format, <b> <i>More Exceptional C++</i> </b> picks up where the widely acclaimed <b> <i>Exceptional C++</i> </b> leaves off, providing successful strategies for solving real-world problems in C++. Drawing from years of in-the-trenches experience, Herb Sutter provides tested techniques and practical solutions for programmers designing modern software systems with C++, from small projects to enterprise applications.</p> <p>Built around forty programming puzzles, <b> <i>More Exceptional C++</i> </b> helps you understand the rules and issues critical to successful software design and development in C++. New themes included in this sequel place a strong emphasis on generic programming, memory management, and using the C++ standard library, including coverage of important techniques like traits and predicates. Also included are guidelines and considerations to remember when using standard containers and algorithms--topics rarely covered in-depth in other sources.</p>Readers will find solutions to such important questions as:<ul> <li>What pitfalls might you encounter when using std::map and std::set, and how can you safely avoid them?</li> <li>What kinds of predicates are safe to use with the STL, what kinds aren't, and why?</li> <li>What techniques are available for writing powerful generic template code that can change its own behavior based on the capabilities of the types it's given to work with?</li> <li>When and how should you optimize your code? Why can (and do) fancy optimizations get us into trouble? And how can some of these answers change if you're writing multithread-safe code?</li> <li>Does exception safety affect class design, or can it be retrofitted in as an afterthought?</li> <li>How can you avoid the Siamese Twin problem when combining inheritance-based libraries from different vendors?</li> <li>How can you safely use auto_ptr, and then use common design patterns to adapt it to avoid common pitfalls? Can you use auto_ptr as a class member? What must you know before you elect to use it that way?</li> <li>Plus one of the most frequently recurring questions about modern C++: When and how should you use namespaces, anyway?</li> </ul> <p>A must-have for the serious programmer, <b> <i>More Exceptional C++</i> </b> provides a thorough and pragmatic understanding of the language while showing you how to write exceptional code in C++. </p> <br> <br> 020170434XB11092001</p><h2>The Metropolitan Museum of Art Guide (Metropolitan Museum of Art Series)</h2><p>This completely reconceived and rewritten guide to the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#39;s encyclopedic holdings-the first new edition of the guidebook in nearly thirty years-provides the ideal introduction to almost 600 essential masterpieces from one of the world&#39;s most popular and beloved art collections.

In this groundbreaking work, renowned anthropologist Philippe Descola seeks to break down this divide, arguing for a departure from the anthropocentric model and its rigid dualistic conception of nature and culture as distinct phenomena. In its stead, Descola proposes a radical new worldview, in which beings and objects, human and nonhuman, are understood through the complex relationships that they possess with one another.&nbsp;</p><i>The Ecology of Others</i> presents a compelling challenge to anthropologists, ecologists, and environmental studies scholars to rethink the way we conceive of humans, objects, and the environment.

It presents, in Spinoza&#39;s famous &#39;geometric method&#39;, his radical views on God, Nature, the human being, and happiness. In this wide-ranging 2006 introduction to the work, Steven Nadler explains the doctrines and arguments of the Ethics, and shows why Spinoza&#39;s endlessly fascinating ideas may have been so troubling to his contemporaries, as well as why they are still highly relevant today. He also examines the philosophical background to Spinoza&#39;s thought and the dialogues in which Spinoza was engaged - with his contemporaries (including Descartes and Hobbes), with ancient thinkers (especially the Stoics), and with his Jewish rationalist forebears. His book is written for the student reader but will also be of interest to specialists in early modern philosophy.</p><p>In this 2006 book, Nadler explains the doctrines and arguments of the Ethics and examines the philosophical background to Spinoza&#39;s thought and the dialogues in which Spinoza was engaged.

It bridges the gap between the mechanics of econometrics and modern applications of econometrics by employing a systematic approach motivated by the major problems facing applied researchers today. Throughout the text, the emphasis on examples gives a concrete reality to economic relationships and allows treatment of interesting policy questions in a realistic and accessible framework.</p><p>Jeffrey M. Wooldridge is a University Distinguished Professor of Economics at Michigan State University, where he has taught since 1991. From 1986 to 1991, he served as Assistant Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Dr. Wooldridge has published more than three dozen articles in internationally recognized journals, as well as several chapters in well-respected books. He is also the author of ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF CROSS SECTION AND PANEL DATA. His work has earned numerous awards, including the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship, the Plura Scripsit award from Econometric Theory, the Sir Richard Stone prize from the Journal of Applied Econometrics, and three graduate teacher-of-the-year awards from MIT.

An essential reference for every serious reader of the Bible.<br><br>B &amp; W illustrations and line-art throughout.</p><p>In the past 30 years , there have been three major encyclopedic Bible dictionaries published in English: The Interpreter's Bible Dictionary (IBD ), the Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible , and The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia ( ISBE ). When it was published in 1962 (with a supplementary volume in 1976), the IBD represented the state of critical Biblical scholarship. The ISBE , though an extensive revision of the previous edition (1929), retained many articles from its predecessors (1915 and 1929). Because of the numerous developments in biblical scholarship during the past three decades, the editor felt (rightly) that it was time for a Bible dictionary that would represent the current state of the discipline. The Anchor Bible Dictionary ( ABD ) is the result of his vision. The ABD is both international and interconfessional, with nearly 1000 contributors from around the world representing Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, and Muslim traditions (and also those of no religious tradition). The list of contributing scholars includes names long associated with biblical and theological studies. The currency of the dictionary as a whole is reflected especially in the inclusion of such subjects as the Dead Sea Scrolls, early Jewish-Christian relations, the historical Jesus, and sociological and literary methods of biblical criticism (including feminist hermeneutics), and in numerous entries on archaeological sites. In addition, the bibliographies are usually up to date and often extensive. Unlike previous Bible dictionaries, the bibliographic entries in the ABD are complete citations, listed individually rather than in a run-on fashion, and hence easier to use. Even in such a monumental success as the ABD , there are weak spots. One might expect to find pronunciations, especially for place and personal names--which is the case with the IBD and the ISBE --but none are given here. There are few illustrations throughout. The maps are inadequate, and some of the topics are handled clumsily. Yet overall, this is a solid piece of work, well written and well edited. It will serve scholars and students because of its currency and thoroughness and lay readers because of its generally readable style. The ABD deserves a place on the shelves beside the standard Bible dictionaries of previous generations and is recommended for public, academic, and seminary libraries.<br><i>- Craig W.

By the 1960s the scientific community roundly refuted this theory. Paul Lawrence Farber traces this revolutionary shift in scientific thought, explaining how developments in modern population biology, genetics, and anthropology proved that opposition to race mixing was a social prejudice with no justification in scientific knowledge.</p><p>In the 1960s, this new knowledge helped to change attitudes toward race and discrimination, especially among college students. Their embrace of social integration caused tension on campuses across the country. Students rebelled against administrative interference in their private lives, and university regulations against interracial dating became a flashpoint in the campus revolts that revolutionized American educational institutions. </p><p>Farber&#x2019;s provocative study is a personal one, featuring interviews with mixed-race couples and stories from the author&#x2019;s student years at the University of Pittsburgh.

Carl Jung wrote a commentary on it, Timothy Leary redesigned it as a guidebook for an acid trip, and the Beatles quoted Leary's version in their song "Tomorrow Never Knows." More recently, the book has been adopted by the hospice movement, enshrined by Penguin Classics, and made into an audiobook read by Richard Gere. Yet, as acclaimed writer and scholar of Buddhism Donald Lopez writes, "<i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> is not really Tibetan, it is not really a book, and it is not really about death." In this compelling introduction and short history, Lopez tells the strange story of how a relatively obscure and malleable collection of Buddhist texts of uncertain origin came to be so revered--and so misunderstood--in the West.</p><br><p> The central character in this story is Walter Evans-Wentz (1878-1965), an eccentric scholar and spiritual seeker from Trenton, New Jersey, who, despite not knowing the Tibetan language and never visiting the country, crafted and named <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>. In fact, Lopez argues, Evans-Wentz's book is much more American than Tibetan, owing a greater debt to Theosophy and Madame Blavatsky than to the lamas of the Land of Snows. Indeed, Lopez suggests that the book's perennial appeal stems not only from its origins in magical and mysterious Tibet, but also from the way Evans-Wentz translated the text into the language of a very American spirituality.</p></p><p><p>"On the history of Buddhism and its transmission to the West, Donald Lopez is the unsurpassable master. The story he tells here about a book that is 'not really Tibetan' and 'not really about death' glistens with delicious ironies and arresting historical parallels. Who else but Lopez would begin a history of <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> with the story of Mormon prophet Joseph Smith--and then, like a mystery writer, reveal the connections at the end? This is a sly and wildly entertaining book."<b>--Kenneth L. Woodward, contributing editor, <i>Newsweek</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> has a wonderful story, and in this fascinating and charming little book, Donald Lopez reveals himself to be a wonderful storyteller."<b>--Jack Miles, author of <i>God: A Biography</i></b></p><p>"This smart, entertaining introduction to <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> is a real delight. Despite its title, Donald Lopez argues, <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> is a uniquely American book and can be properly read and understood only from that perspective. He demonstrates this by exposing its direct links to American Theosophy and spiritualism at the dawn of the New Age in the early twentieth century, while also drawing interesting parallels to the visionary beginnings of Mormonism."<b>--Bryan J. Cuevas, author of <i>The Hidden History of the Tibetan Book of the Dead</i></b></p><p>"This book offers a fascinating and fresh discussion of <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> and its life as a text in the United States. Donald Lopez argues that persistent threads in American religious life--the tradition of the 'found' text as a repository for ancient wisdom, and a philosophical interest in life after death--help explain the overwhelming success of the book and its endurance as a cultural artifact."<b>--Laurie F.

His writing has rendered the physical landscape of the South Carolina lowcountry familiar to legions of readers, and it has staked out a more complex geography as well, one defined by domestic trauma, racial anxiety, religious uncertainty, and cultural ambivalence. <br><br>In Understanding Pat Conroy, Catherine Seltzer engages in a sustained consideration of Conroy and his work. The study begins with a sketch of Conroy's biography, a narrative that, while fascinating in its own right, is employed here to illuminate many of the motifs and characters that define his work and to locate him within southern literary tradition. The volume then moves on to explore each of Conroy's major works, tracing the evolution of the themes within and among each of his novels, including The Great Santini, The Lords of Discipline, The Prince of Tides, Beach Music, and South of Broad, and his memoirs, among them The Water Is Wide and My Losing Season.<br><br>Seltzer's insightful close readings of Conroy's work are supplemented by interviews and archival material, shedding new light on the often-complex dynamics between text and context in Conroy's oeuvre. More broadly Understanding Pat Conroy also explores the ways that Conroy delights in troubling the boundaries that circumscribe the literary establishment. Seltzer links Conroy's work to existing debates about the contemporary American canon, and, like Conroy's work itself, Understanding Pat Conroy will be of interest to his readers, students of American literature, and new and veteran South watchers.</p><p>Catherine Seltzer an associate professor of English and women&#39;s studies at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, is the author of Elizabeth Spencer&#39;s Complicated Cartographies: Reimagining Home, the South, and Southern Literary Production."In light of the UCAL goal of guiding and instructing nonacademic readers, Seltzer succeeds admirably. Her opening chapter not only outlines the basic facts of Conroy's life, but also questions the rocky critical reception his works have received." &#x2015; The Georgia Review<br>"Catherine Seltzer's elegantly written, sophisticated study carves a vital space for Pat Conroy in the literary canon. As she demonstrates, Conroy's work engages powerfully with the ongoing struggles of individuals trying to come to terms with the ways the South is still viewed as a region defined by strong racial divisions and entrenched patriarchal hierarchies. Ultimately, she makes clear that Conroy is a writer of deep intelligence, passion, and generosity of spirit."&#x2015;Thomas Fahy, author of Understanding Truman Capote and Staging Modern American Life<br>"An extremely insightful and well-written study of Conroy and of the autobiographical impulse that has driven the author, demonstrated in his fiction as well as nonfiction. Seltzer makes a case for why this 'popular' writer should be taken seriously by critics and scholars as well."&#x2015;Fred Hobson, Lineberger Distinguished Professor in the Humanities Emeritus, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill<br>"Pat Conroy is the only writer I know who is as passionate about rage as he is about tenderness, and that is what Catherine Seltzer's excellent book of profoundly insightful essays tells us. The bridge of language between those two emotional poles is the watermark of Pat's extraordinary literature."&#x2015;Terry Kay, author of To Dance with the White Dog and The Book of Marie<br>"Catherine Seltzer has managed to thread the needle with a book that will both inform Conroy scholars and delight fans.

He is separated from his family as they are swept up in the government&#x2019;s mass deportation of Armenians into internment camps. Gradually realizing the unthinkable&#x2014;that they are all being driven to their deaths&#x2014;he fights, through starvation and thirst, not to lose hope. Just before killing squads slaughter his caravan during a forced desert march, Stepan manages to escape, making a perilous six-day trek to the Euphrates River carrying nothing more than two cups of water and one gold coin. In his desperate bid for survival, Stepan dons disguises, outmaneuvers gendarmes, and, when he least expects it, encounters the miraculous kindness of strangers.<br><br><i>The Hundred-Year Walk</i> alternates between Stepan&#x2019;s saga and another journey that takes place a century later, after his family discovers his long-lost journals. Reading this rare firsthand account, his granddaughter Dawn MacKeen finds herself first drawn into the colorful bazaars before the war and then into the horrors Stepan later endured. Inspired to retrace his steps, she sets out alone to Turkey and Syria, shadowing her resourceful, resilient grandfather across a landscape still rife with tension. With his journals guiding her, she grows ever closer to the man she barely knew as a child. Their shared story is a testament to family, to home, and to the power of the human spirit to transcend the barriers of religion, ethnicity, and even time itself.<br><br></p><p>Praise for <i>The Hundred-Year Walk</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Part family heirloom, part history lesson, <i>The Hundred-Year Walk</i> is an emotionally poignant work, powerfully imagined and expertly crafted. The considerable archival scaffolding remains invisible as MacKeen carries her readers on an emotional journey full of heartache and hope.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Aline Ohanesian</b>, author of <i>Orhan&#x2019;s Inheritance</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In her remarkable book, <i>The Hundred-Year Walk</i>, Dawn MacKeen has taken the Armenian genocide and shown us its terrifying flesh, blood, bone, and sinew. Her vehicle is her grandfather&#x2019;s forced deportation, and she uses it to take the reader on a horrific ride into the heart of one of history&#x2019;s darkest moments.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>S.C. Gwynne</b>, author of <i>Empire of the Summer Moon</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am in awe of what Dawn MacKeen has done here. With the meticulousness of an historian, the courage of an investigative reporter, and the compassion of a daughter mining a fraught and cherished family legacy, MacKeen has accomplished the near impossible. She has elucidated a complicated ethnic and political history through a delightfully literary lens. Her sentences sing. Her research shines. Her readers will be rapt&#x2014;and a lot smarter by the end.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Meghan Daum</b>, author of <i>The Unspeakable: And Other Subjects of Discussion</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so easy to be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of wars and atrocities that continually afflict our tragic species. But Dawn MacKeen has found a hauntingly personal way to evoke one such epic disaster, Turkey&#x2019;s mass deportation and extermination of Armenians during World War I&#x2014;the twentieth century&#x2019;s first genocide. By telling the riveting story of her grandfather Stepan, who&#x2014;like the armies of refugees today&#x2014;overcame daunting odds as he braved the Turkish gauntlet of death and walked across desert sands to safety, MacKeen drives home that we&#x2019;re all part of the human family. <i>The Hundred-Year Walk</i> is an unforgettable contribution to the literature of suffering and memory, and to the growing conviction that we must say &#x201c;Never again&#x201d; to the mass destruction of human life and culture.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>David Talbot,</b> founder of Salon.com and author of <i>The Devil&#x2019;s Chessboard: Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise of America&#x2019;s Secret Government</i><br>DAWN ANAHID MACKEEN is an award-winning investigative journalist who spent nearly a decade on her grandfather&#x2019;s story.

But it is about how we talk about music, cookery, and sex-or, indeed, anything at all." Language is so fundamental to everyday life that we take it for granted. But as David Crystal makes clear in this work of unprecedented scope, language is an extremely powerful tool that defines the human species. <br><br> Crystal offers general readers a personal tour of the intricate workings of language. He moves effortlessly from big subjects like the origins of languages, how children learn to speak, and how conversation works to subtle but revealing points such as how email differs from both speech and writing in important ways, how language reveals a person's social status, and how we decide whether a word is rude or polite. <br><br> Broad and deep, but with a light and witty touch, <i>How Language Works</i> is the ultimate layman's guide to how we communicate with one another.</p><p>A parrot uncomprehendingly rattles off a string of words learned by rote. And we marvel! Yet we seem to take our own astonishing linguistic powers for granted&#x2014;the ability to speak, listen, and understand, to read and write. We all understand why language works&#x2014;we have to communicate to survive&#x2014;and now David Crystal, the world authority on language, shows us how.How are languages born? How does conversation work? How do we learn how to read? How do gestures and tone of voice impact communication? And what happens when a language goes wrong? How Language Works answers questions about the innumerable facets of language, from how we absorb all those grammatical rules to how we decide if a word is rude or polite. Whether looking at the whistle languages of the Canary Islands, or describing the layout of the human throat; whether assessing the importance of eyebrow flashes in conversation, or showing how the way we speak betrays who we want to be&#x2014;How Language Works is a book that will enrich the lives of everyone who reads it. Illuminating and intriguing, this landmark book is the ultimate guide to the mysteries of the language we all use every day.David Crystal is honorary professor of linguistics at the University of Wales, Bangor, and the editor of <b>The Penguin Encyclopedia</b>. <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Navigating Life with Parkinson Disease (Neurology Now Books) (Brain and Life Books)</h2><p>Here is a marvelous guide for anyone affected by Parkinson's disease--patients, caregivers, family members, and friends.

This book is an introduction to the concepts of computer programming within the context of the visual arts. It offers a comprehensive reference and text for Processing (www.processing.org), an open-source programming language that can be used by students, artists, designers, architects, researchers, and anyone who wants to program images, animation, and interactivity. The ideas in Processing have been tested in classrooms, workshops, and arts institutions, including UCLA, Carnegie Mellon, New York University, and Harvard University. Tutorial units make up the bulk of the book and introduce the syntax and concepts of software (including variables, functions, and object-oriented programming), cover such topics as photography and drawing in relation to software, and feature many short, prototypical example programs with related images and explanations. More advanced professional projects from such domains as animation, performance, and typography are discussed in interviews with their creators. "Extensions" present concise introductions to further areas of investigation, including computer vision, sound, and electronics. Appendixes, references to additional material, and a glossary contain additional technical details. Processing can be used by reading each unit in order, or by following each category from the beginning of the book to the end. The Processing software and all of the code presented can be downloaded and run for future exploration.Includes essays by Alexander R. Galloway, Golan Levin, R.

The book"s modular structure allows for different combinations of its units and self-directed reading. Interviews with artists who create software-based works and extension chapters that expand software practice into computer vision, sound, and electronics successfully connect the realms of art and technology. Now used by artists, visual designers, and in educational institutions around the world, Processing has been groundbreaking not only as an alternative language for expanding programming space, but as an attempt to nurture programming literacy in the broader context of art and cultural production."<b>Christiane Paul </b>, Adjunct Curator of New Media Arts, Whitney Museum of American Art</p><br><br><p>"Processing is a milestone not only in the history of computer software, of information design, and of the visual arts, but also in social history.

H. Lawrence</h2><p>Sitting down to write a book about his hero D. H. Lawrence, Geoff Dyer finds himself compelled to write about anything else. He is in fact compelled to do more or less anything else instead of write. In Sicily he is too preoccupied by his hatred of seafood to follow the great writer's footsteps; in Mexico he cannot get beyond a drug-induced erotic fantasy on a nudist beach . . . And yet, incredibly, this attempt to write a 'sober academic study' reveals the hold Lawrence and his work still exert on us today. <i>Out of Sheer Rage</i> is a complete one-off, a richly comic study of the combination of bad temper, procrastination and the uncanny power of obliquity.</p><p><i>Out of Sheer Rage: Wrestling with D.H. Lawrence</i> is the best book about not writing a book about D.H Lawrence ever written. Other people have written untraditional, even loopy tributes to the priest of love before--including boon companions Anais Nin and Henry Miller--but no one has done it with Dyer's chutzpah, or with such fantastic success.<p> Dyer started out with the intention of writing either a sober academic study of Lawrence or a novel based on his subject's life but couldn't seem to do either. The academic study, he realized, was really just an excuse to read Lawrence's work, and the novel never even acquired a rudimentary shape in his mind. Instead, he somehow convinced his publisher to pick up the tab for his lengthy globetrotting pilgrimage, which took him from Paris to Rome to Greece to Oxford--not to mention such Lawrentian hotspots as Taos and Mexico and San Francisco. The result is an extended, often hilarious, meditation on seafood, English TV, Dyer's own creative impulses, and occasionally even Lawrence.</p><p> In Lawrence's seminal prose he finds some justification for his own capricious indulgences: "What Lawrence's life demonstrates so powerfully is that it actually takes a daily effort to be free.... There are intervals of repose but there will never come a state of definitive rest where you can give up because you have turned freedom into a permanent condition. Freedom is always precarious." Yet he refuses to read Lawrence's novels, confining himself to letters, travel reportage, and other casuals. Indeed, "[o]ne gets so weary watching authors' sensations and thoughts get novelised, set into the concrete of fiction, that perhaps it is best to avoid the novel as a medium of expression."</p><p> Dyer's fascination with Lawrence's minorabilia suggests not only an oblique criticism of the contemporary novel, but a promising direction for the memoir. Perhaps clean, well-lighted subjectivity is a dead end, and the future lies with eccentric, provisional works along the lines of <i>Flaubert's Parrot</i> and <i>How Proust Can Change Your Life</i>--or <i>Out of Sheer Rage</i>. After all, Dyer's bright (and brilliantly shambolic) book of life reminds us of why we read in the first place: to see the surprising ways one person can be brought to life by another. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p><b>'The funniest book I have ever read' Steve Martin</b></p><h2>The Psychic Side of Sports</h2><p>Psychic Side of Sports [Paperback]</p><p></p><h2>Spirit-Filled Woman&#39;s Devotional Bible-NKJV</h2><p><p><strong>The Holy Scriptures are our letter from home.

As our first technology for contemplation of the self, the mirror is arguably as important an invention as the wheel. <i>Mirror Mirror</i> is the fascinating story of the mirror's invention, refinement, and use in an astonishing range of human activities--from the fantastic mirrored rooms that wealthy Romans created for their orgies to the mirror's key role in the use and understanding of light. Pendergrast spins tales of the 2,500year mystery of whether Archimedes and his "burning mirror" really set faraway Roman ships on fire; the medieval Venetian glassmakers, who perfected the technique of making large, flat mirrors from clear glass and for whom any attempt to leave their cloistered island was punishable by death; Isaac Newton, whose experiments with sunlight on mirrors once left him blinded for three days; the artist David Hockney, who holds controversial ideas about Renaissance artists and their use of optical devices; and George Ellery Hale, the manic-depressive astronomer and telescope enthusiast who inspired (and gave his name to) the twentieth century's largest ground-based telescope. Like mirrors themselves, <i>Mirror Mirror</i> is a book of endless wonder and fascination.</p><p><b>Mark Pendergrast</b> was born in Atlanta and is a graduate of Harvard University. A business journalist, he has published articles and reviews in a number of magazines and newspapers, including the New York Times, the Sunday Times (London), and Financial Analyst.After exploring the history of coffee in Uncommon Grounds, Pendergrast now takes up another common object-the mirror. How it evolved from the polished ornaments of ancient sun worshippers and an essential of 17th-century palace decor to the modern glass in everyman's bathroom is only one theme in this chronological survey. Throughout its history, Pendergrast shows, the mirror has symbolized vanity, self-examination and the limits of human understanding. He identifies the mirror as a favorite metaphor in Elizabethan literature; he also traces mirrors back to Greek myths and forward to Lewis Carroll's classic Through the Looking-Glass. A third theme is the magic mirror, into which conjurers have peered to communicate with the other world. Though condemned by the Church, this practice, called scrying, enjoyed a revival during the Renaissance and again during the Victorian spiritualism craze, while vaudevillian "smoke and mirror" shows flourished and toys for creating optical illusions provided home entertainment. Shifting to mirrors in science, Pendergrast describes optics from early philosophers' theories of vision through quantum physicists' discovery of light's dual particle-wave nature. Though informative, long technical sections about reflecting telescopes and other subjects will frustrate the reader lured by the book's suggestive subtitle. In the conclusion, Pendergrast speculates on the ability to recognize oneself in the mirror as evidence of a self-awareness unique to higher animals. If Pendergrast had shown more self-awareness as a writer, however, he might have resisted the urge to impose a chronological framework and to include seemingly every fact from his notes.

For example, the text gives students black letter law in plain English at the start of many chapters. For key topics (such as confidentiality, conflicts of interest, and communicating with adverse parties), outlines summarize the law clearly and concisely. Other topics begin with short introductory essays about the law. This way, a student can quickly grasp the basic concepts and be ready to spend class time discussing more sophisticated, interesting, and important issues. <br><br> <b>Lawyers and the Legal Profession</b> thrusts students into the middle of the debate over current ethical issues and the ethical realities of everyday practice. The notes and questions stimulate interesting class discussions while the many problems and longer scenarios provide you the concrete situations in which to anchor the dialogue. The casebook provokes vigorous classroom debate while assisting students in developing the capacity for ethical judgment that is so vital to the profession.</p><p></p><h2>Vertebrate Dissection</h2><p>This classic lab manual offers instructions for the dissection of representative vertebrates for any vertebrate dissection course.</p><p>Warren F.

This book explores many issues that are rarely addressed in formal educational experiences for example, organizational politics, the negative "side effects" of being a therapist, keeping up with cutting-edge innovations, sustaining a private practice, and planning for the future and offers concrete suggestions for adapting to the world outside graduate school. Personal, easygoing writing style, the hallmark of Kottler's previous bestselling books, makes this an engaging and provocative read.</p><p><strong>Jeffrey A.

In this third edition of Cultural Resource Laws and Practice, Thomas F. King presents clear, practical information for those who need to navigate the labyrinth of cultural resource management (CRM). He discusses the various federal, state, and local laws governing the protection of resources, how they have been interpreted, how they operate in practice, and even how they are sometimes in contradiction with each other. He provides helpful advice on how to ensure regulatory compliance in dealing with archaeological sites, historic buildings, urban districts, sacred sites and objects, shipwrecks, and archives. King also offers careful guidance through the confusing array of federal, state, and tribal offices concerned with cultural resource management.</p><p>Thomas F. King has worked in historic preservation since the mid-1960s as an academic, a contractor, and a government official. During 1977-79 he organized historic preservation programs in the islands of Micronesia, and from 1979-88 he oversaw Section 106 review for the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. He is the author of four AltaMira Press books on cultural resource management among his many writings on this topic and is in demand as a consultant and workshop instructor on the subject.This third edition is certainly no mere reprint. Dr. King has rearranged some of the discussion to make the sequence of information more logical; he has tweaked the language in places so that it is more understandable; and, of course, he has brought up to date all changes in laws and regulations and examined the consequences of these changes. This is still the best book on how historic preservation in the U.S. works, and how Dr. King, one of the most experienced practitioners in the business, thinks it might work better. (Hester Davis, Arkansas Archaeological Society)<br><br>This informative book deals comprehensively with cultural resource laws and regulations as well as professional practice and guidelines. King shows how these various elements of cultural resource policy conform to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). This third edition also incorporates relevant information regarding social impact assessment, Native American cultures, environmental justice, collaborative participation, and cultural resource management plans. <i>Cultural Resource Laws and Practice</i> is essential reading for students interested in heritage resource management and for professionals who work as consultants within the NEPA process. (Larry Canter, Environmental Impact Training)</p><h2>A History of the Ozarks, Volume 2: The Conflicted Ozarks (Volume 2)</h2><p>The Ozarks of the mid-1800s was a land of divisions. The uplands and its people inhabited a geographic and cultural borderland straddling Midwest and west, North and South, frontier and civilization, and secessionist and Unionist. As civil war raged across the region, neighbor turned against neighbor, unleashing a generation of animus and violence that lasted long after 1865. The second volume of Brooks Blevins&#39;s history begins with the region&#39;s distinctive relationship to slavery. Largely unsuitable for plantation farming, the Ozarks used enslaved persons on a smaller scale or, in some places, not at all. Blevins moves on to the devastating Civil War years where the dehumanizing, personal nature of Ozark conflict was made uglier by the predations of marching armies and criminal gangs. Blending personal stories with a wide narrative scope, he examines how civilians and soldiers alike experienced the war, from brutal partisan warfare to ill-advised refugee policies to women&#39;s struggles to safeguard farms and stay alive in an atmosphere of constant danger. The war stunted the region&#39;s growth, delaying the development of Ozarks society and the processes of physical, economic, and social reconstruction. More and more, striving uplanders dedicated to modernization fought an image of the Ozarks as a land of mountaineers and hillbillies hostile to the idea of progress. Yet the dawn of the twentieth century saw the uplands emerge as an increasingly uniform culture forged, for better and worse, in the tumult of a conflicted era.</p><p><b>Brooks Blevins</b> is the Noel Boyd Professor of Ozarks Studies at Missouri State University. He is the author or editor of nine books, including<i> A History of the Ozarks, Volume 1: The Old Ozarks; Ghost of the Ozarks: Murder and Memory in the Upland South</i>; and <i>Arkansas, Arkansaw: How Bear Hunters, Hillbillies, and Good Ol' Boys Defined a State.</i>"No states suffered the Uncivil War more than Missouri and Arkansas, and no region of these states witnessed the fullest measure of incivility than the Ozarks. Brooks Blevins's masterful second volume offers a fine-grain narrative of people who might be unfamiliar to many."&#x2014;Silas Turnbo, William Monks, Sempronius H. Boyd, Alf Bolin, William T. Leeper, Lina Hermann, and the Bald Knobbers<br><br> "--but whose powerful stories relocate this former periphery of the war and its aftermath firmly at the center of the long Civil War and Reconstruction."--Christopher Phillips, author of<i> The Rivers Ran Backward: The Civil War and the Remaking of the American Middle Border</i><br><br>"Brooks Blevins&#x2019;s second volume of<i> A History of the Ozarks</i> is the work of a premier historian and a master storyteller. Whether the topic is Civil War guerrillas or postwar Bald Knobbers, Blevins peels away the layers of myth and legend to reveal the region&#x2019;s heritage and history in all its complexity. Highly recommended for both the scholar and the general reader."--William Garrett Piston, coauthor of <i>Wilson&#x2019;s Creek: The Second Battle of the Civil War and the Men Who Fought It</i><br> &nbsp; "A well-researched and detailed account of the violent life of the Ozarks during and after the Civil War." --<i>St. Louis Post Dispatch</i></p><h2>Hamlet (The Arden Edition of the Works of William Shakespeare)</h2><p>The text of the classic tragedy about the struggle of Prince Hamlet to avenge his father&#39;s murder is accompanied by extensive critical notes and historical commentary</p><p>Undoubtedly the most famous of all of Shakespeare's plays, <i>Hamlet</i> remains one of the most enduring but also enigmatic pieces of western literature. The story of Hamlet, the young Prince of Denmark, his tortured relationship with his mother, and his quest to avenge his father's murder at the hand of his brother Claudius has fascinated writers and audiences ever since it was written around 1600. <p> For many years interest focused on both Hamlet's inability to avenge his father's death, claiming that "the native hue of resolution / Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought", and, according to none other than Freud, his oedipal fixation with his mother. However, more recently critics have turned their attention to <i>Hamlet's</i> bold theatrical self-reflexivity (most famously reflected in the performance of "The Mousetrap"), its fascination with issues of theology and Renaissance humanism, and its dense, complex poetic language. What is so remarkable about the play is the way in which it tends to uncannily reflect the concerns of different epochs. As a result, Hamlet has been at different moments defined as a romantic rebel, an angst-ridden existentialist, a paralysed intellectual and an ambivalent New Man. Whatever subsequent generations make of <i>Hamlet</i>, they are unlikely to exhaust the possibilities of this most extraordinary play. --<i>Jerry Brotton</i></p></p><h2>Word Virus: The William S. Burroughs Reader</h2><p>A collection of the American literary innovator&#39;s essential writings</p><p>"William was a shootist. He shot like he wrote-with extreme precision and no fear."-Hunter S. Thompson <p>With the publication of Naked Lunch in 1959, William Burroughs brought international letters into the postmodern age, but he had already begun to chart the course that would establish him as one of postwar America's most influential writers. Word Virus: The William S. Burroughs Reader brings together selections of Burroughs' most important and challenging work-beginning with his very early writing (including a chapter from his and Jack Kerouac's never-before-seen collaborative novel, And The Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks) and following his trajectory through My Education: A Book of Dreams. </p><p>Word Virus: The William S. Burroughs Reader follows major themes in Burroughs' oeuvre while also serving up a sampling of his darkly hilarious "routines," and is edited to serve as a tool for the scholar as well as an overview of his entire body of work for the general reader. Important biographical information, contained in the chapter introductions, provide key links to understanding the work in the context of the life. Ann Douglas's introductory essay provides further background on Burroughs in the context of American letters and his Beat contemporaries. </p><p>Throughout a life that spanned the better part of the twentieth century, William Burroughs managed to be a visionary among writers: he imagined the Internet decades before its appearance and peered into the future of other technologies, kept the pace of world affairs and cultural trends, and, with each of his books, introduced new possibilities for the form. When he died in the summer of 1997, the world of letters lost its most elegant outsider. </p><p>Praise for Word Virus:<br> "The best of the late gentleman junkie's literary arsenal . . . For Burroughs virgins and devotees alike."-Details </p><p>"Word Virus: The Williams S. Burroughs Reader finally brings the author's actual writing back to the forefront. In their selections, editors James Grauerholz and Ira Silverberg highlight the many faces of Burroughs: the narrative pioneer, the sardonic stand-up, the asexual Tiresias-like seer, and, in what may be a surprise to many, the humanist. . . . Apocalyptic, carnal and raw, Burroughs' work bridges the epiphanies of modernism with the Foucaultian cool of postmodernism. He stretches modernist forms and grammar like narrative silly putty, prefiguring the sly mischief of postmodern writers such as Thomas Pynchon and William Gibson. . . . Through it all Burroughs eludes easy literary classifications; by turns he is poststructuralist Dashiell Hammett, T.S. Eliot on the nod, Mark Twain with a gun . . . . Word Virus [is] a fantastic, weird, disturbing and intriguing tribute to an inimitable American voice."-Mark Luce, Salon </p><p>"This well-edited collection of Burroughs' work...reminds us of his restless, savage intelligence and complicated insider-outsider perspective on human society."-Out </p><p>"The deadpan graddad of postmodernism is well represented in this bountiful collection of fiction, essays and collaborations from all stages of Burroughs's (1913-1997) career. . . . Dark humor runs through this collection."-Publishers Weekly </p><p>"A stringent modernist, a spiritual child of Joyce . . . The reader of this volume will find the anarchy of Burroughs' finely tuned mind well represented . . . Editors Grauerholz and Silverberg show sensitivity in their choice of selections from Burroughs' long and productive career; their dedication to his legacy is evident. There is a very informative and compassionate introduction by Ann Douglas."-Raul Nio, Booklist </p><p>"This judiciously edited collection contains representative excerpts from a lifetime's published work . . . An excellent introduction to the man and his work, this carefully designed reader belongs in all literature collections."-William Gargan, Library Journal </p><p>"William S. Burroughs, who died last year, was the American master of the post-modernist novel...the prophet of the dark streak in the American soul. . . . Now, two of Burroughs' editors have compiled an anthology from his many works that gives the reader a remarkable picture of the writer's depth and versatility....On display are the varying styles Burroughs used during a long career of writing, and examples of the power, the strangeness, the wit and the occasional beauty of his writing."-Roger Harris, Newark Star Ledger </p><p>"Burroughs belongs, all alone, to an Age of Reason, which he locates in the future. . . . Like a classical satirist, Burroughs is dead serious-a reformer. Yet, as often happened with the classical satirists, a wild hilarity and savage pessimism carry him beyond his therapeutic purpose."-Mary McCarthy </p><p>"The only American novelist who may conceivably be possessed by genius."-Norman Mailer </p><p>"It is amusing to read reviews of Burroughs that try to classify his books as nonbooks. It is a little like trying to criticize the sartorial and verbal manifestations of a man who is knocking on the door to explain that ames are leaping from the roof of our home."-Marshall McLuhan </p><p>"Burroughs' voice is hard, derisive, inventive, free, funny, serious, poetic, indelibly American, a voice in which one hears transistor radios and old movies and all the cliches and all the cons and all the newspapers, all the peculiar optimism, all the failure."-Joan Didion </p><p>"Burroughs is the greatest satirical writer since Jonathan Swift."-Jack Kerouac </p><p>"Burroughs seems to revel in a new medium . . . a medium totally fantastic, spaceless, timeless, in which the normal sentence is fractured, the cosmic tries to push through the tawdry."-Anthony Burgess </p><p>"He's a writer of enormous richness whose books are a kind of attempt to blow up this cozy conspiracy, to allow us to see the truth."-J. G. Ballard</p>The deadpan granddad of postmodernism is well represented in this bountiful collection of fiction, essays and collaborations from all stages of Burroughs's (1914-1997) long career. Burroughs's companion, longtime editor and literary executor Grauerholz, and Grove editor Silverberg include selections from the writer's better-known works, as well as sections of the experimental "cut-up" novels?complete enough to give readers a feel for the form without exhausting those unaccustomed to Burroughs's disjointed sharpness. Dark humor runs throughout the collection, from the 1938 collaboration "Twilight's Last Gleamings," in which the cross-dressing captain of a sinking ship murders his way onto a lifeboat, to a wry account of Burroughs's stint as a cockroach exterminator. What may prove most valuable to readers is the inclusion of Burroughs's commentary on his aims and intent. "Remembering Jack Kerouac" recalls the way the younger Kerouac prodded Burroughs to write. In the manifesto "Les Voleurs," Burroughs celebrates "stealing" words, a cure for "the fetish of originality." Perhaps most surprising are the passages both melancholic and elegiac, such as this, from The Western Lands: "A tree like black-lace against a gray sky. A flash of joy." In a selection from My Education, Burroughs provides an apt description for this collection: "Each page is a door to everything is permitted." <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Singing Book (Second Edition)</h2><p><p><strong><em>The Singing Book</em> gets students singing on the very first day.</strong></p> With a "sing first, talk later" philosophy encouraging beginning students to sing without judgment or criticism, <em>The Singing Book</em> opens the door to learning repertoire and the more technical aspects of the voice.

The book first lays out the &#x2018;geochemical toolbox&#x2019;: the basic principles and techniques of modern geochemistry, beginning with a review of thermodynamics and kinetics as they apply to the Earth and its environs. These basic concepts are then applied to understanding processes in aqueous systems and the behavior of trace elements in magmatic systems.&nbsp; Subsequent chapters introduce radiogenic and stable isotope geochemistry and illustrate their application to such diverse topics as determining geologic time, ancient climates, and the diets of prehistoric peoples. The focus then broadens to the formation of the solar system, the Earth, and the elements themselves. Then the composition of the Earth itself becomes the topic, examining the composition of the core, the mantle, and the crust and exploring how this structure originated.

The difficulty of doing without fossil fuels is daunting, possibly even insurmountable. So there is an urgent need to rethink our responses to the crisis. To meet that need, a small but increasingly influential group of scientists is exploring proposals for planned human intervention in the climate system: a stratospheric veil against the sun, the cultivation of photosynthetic plankton, fleets of unmanned ships seeding the clouds. These are the technologies of geoengineering&#x2015;and as Oliver Morton argues in this visionary book, it would be as irresponsible to ignore them as it would be foolish to see them as a simple solution to the problem.</p><p><i>The Planet Remade</i> explores the history, politics, and cutting-edge science of geoengineering. Morton weighs both the promise and perils of these controversial strategies and puts them in the broadest possible context. The past century&#x2019;s changes to the planet&#x2015;to the clouds and the soils, to the winds and the seas, to the great cycles of nitrogen and carbon&#x2015;have been far more profound than most of us realize. Appreciating those changes clarifies not just the scale of what needs to be done about global warming, but also our relationship to nature.</p><p>Climate change is not just one of the twenty-first century&#x2019;s defining political challenges. Morton untangles the implications of our failure to meet the challenge of climate change and reintroduces the hope that we might. He addresses the deep fear that comes with seeing humans as a force of nature, and asks what it might mean&#x2015;and what it might require of us&#x2015;to try and use that force for good.</p></p><p><p>"Oliver Morton displays here again the usual virtues of his writing, which include a sparkling clarity maintained even when conveying huge complex masses of information, often about topics new to all of us; and then, even more importantly, good judgment. He makes distinctions when evaluating gnarly problems, and explains the distinctions very persuasively, and with a generous dry wit. All these abilities are now devoted to perhaps the crucial question of our time, the climate, making this simply a Necessary Book, which is also a pleasure to read. Maybe that combination makes it sui generis, but in any case it's an important addition to current discourse, an excellent way to get oriented to our most pressing environmental problem, and I urge people to read it and ponder its news."<b>--Kim Stanley Robinson, author of <i>Red Mars and Aurora</i></b></p><p>"This is the first book to properly consider the dimensions of the new world we are living in. Morton's book is indispensable, highly readable, and incredibly timely."<b>--Mark Lynas, author of <i>The God Species</i></b></p><p>"A scholar and a fine literary stylist, Oliver Morton sets the geoengineering debate in a fascinating historical and social context. <i>The Planet Remade</i> is much the best book on the subject and deserves a wide readership."<b>--Martin Rees, author of <i>Our Final Century</i></b></p><p>"One of the most important and provocative books I've read in years. <i>The Planet Remade</i> is essential for policymakers, environmentalists, skeptics, and anyone else who prefers their views on climate change to be based on evidence rather than rhetoric."<b>--Hari Kunzru, <i>author of Gods without Men</i></b></p><p>"Written with the grace and clarity its subject demands, <i>The Planet Remade</i> offers just what the issue of climate change needs: fresh thinking about what can be done, based on deep respect for the planet, the science, and the concerns of people with differing points of view. It's an enriching addition to the literature of possible worlds."<b>--Marek Kohn, author of <i>A Reason for Everything and Turned Out Nice</i></b></p><p>"Deeply rooted in history and smartly optimistic about the future, this is--by far--the best book yet on geoengineering."<b>--David Keith, Harvard University and author of <i>A Case for Climate Engineering</i></b></p><p>"In Morton's new book, he takes on some of the most challenging issues of our age. It is a readable and thought-provoking look at humanity's dance with hubristic ideas and deeds regarding the manipulation of the environment on a planetary scale. He is clearly one of the best science writers of our day."<b>--Steven Hamburg, Environmental Defense Fund</b></p><p>"Taking a sensible and low-key approach to a rather provocative subject, Morton shows why geoengineering is something that the mainstream will need to consider--it's not something just for the fringes."<b>--Ken Caldeira, Carnegie Institution for Science</b></p><p>"Morton accessibly describes the potential and risks of geoengineering and puts them in the context of climate change and other large-scale interventions that humans have had on the earth system or might seek to have in the future."<b>--Tim Kruger, University of Oxford</b></p><p>"Engaging, persuasive, and thought provoking. Morton discusses the potential role and consequences of geoengineering and puts forward his own carefully considered views on the subject. <i>The Planet Remade</i> is a tour de force of wide-ranging scholarship as well as a soundly argued polemic."<b>--John Shepherd, University of Southampton</b></p><b>Oliver Morton</b> is briefings editor at the <i>Economist</i>, and his writing has appeared in the <i>New Yorker</i> and other publications.

This work--unusual for its symbolism and structure, its criticism of Christian institutions, and its many-layered storytelling--was Thoreau's first published book.</p><br><p> In the late summer of 1839, Thoreau and his older brother John made a two-week boat-and-hiking trip from Concord, Massachusetts, to the White Mountains of New Hampshire. After John's sudden death in 1842, Thoreau began to prepare a memorial account of their excursion. He wrote two drafts of this story at Walden Pond, which he continued to revise and expand until 1849, when he arranged for its publication at his own expense. The book's heterodoxy and apparent formlessness troubled its contemporary audience. Modern readers, however, have come to see it as an appropriate predecessor to <i>Walden</i>, with Thoreau's story of a river journey depicting the early years of his spiritual and artistic growth.</p></p><p><b>John McPhee</b> is the author of twenty-five books, including <i>The Control of Nature, Irons in the Fire</i>, and <i>Annals of the Former World</i>, for which he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1999.</p><h2>The Legal, Professional, and Ethical Dimensions of Education in Nursing</h2><p><p>The only volume on higher education law written specifically for nursing faculty, this volume imparts the basic foundations of the legal, professional, and ethical issues that concern faculty on a daily basis.

It is perfect for a stand-alone course focused on sustainability problem solving, whether inside the classroom through case studies or out in the real-world. The book is a reasonable length, such that it can be used as supplemental reading for any course in any discipline that is focused on using disciplinary knowledge to resolve real-world sustainability problems.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable World: Approaches to Analyzing and Resolving Wicked Problems'</em></strong> content draws from a wide range of disciplines that define the emerging 21st century field of sustainability science, including anthropology, business, ecology, economics, science and technology studies, sociology, urban planning, and major others. The book&#x2019;s focus is on developing five key sustainability competencies (system thinking, normative, anticipatory, strategic, and interpersonal) that foster the knowledge, skills, and understandings needed by change-agents to resolve sustainability problems in the real-world. The book includes an introduction to sustainability and socio-ecological system complexity and also to each component of the sustainability science problem solving approach: current state analysis, future scenarios, visioning, and transition strategies. Core Questions and Key Concepts structure each chapter&#x2019;s content. End-of-chapter case studies, discussion questions, and projects allow for exploration and application of concepts.</p></p><p></p><h2>Freedom and Neurobiology: Reflections on Free Will, Language, and Political Power (Columbia Themes in Philosophy)</h2><p>Our self-conception derives mostly from our own experience. We believe ourselves to be conscious, rational, social, ethical, language-using, political agents who possess free will. Yet we know we exist in a universe that consists of mindless, meaningless, unfree, nonrational, brute physical particles. How can we resolve the conflict between these two visions?<br><br>In <i>Freedom and Neurobiology</i>, the philosopher John Searle discusses the possibility of free will within the context of contemporary neurobiology. He begins by explaining the relationship between human reality and the more fundamental reality as described by physics and chemistry. Then he proposes a neurobiological resolution to the problem by demonstrating how various conceptions of free will have different consequences for the neurobiology of consciousness. <br><br>In the second half of the book, Searle applies his theory of social reality to the problem of political power, explaining the role of language in the formation of our political reality. The institutional structures that organize, empower, and regulate our lives-money, property, marriage, government-consist in the assignment and collective acceptance of certain statuses to objects and people. Whether it is the president of the United States, a twenty-dollar bill, or private property, these entities perform functions as determined by their status in our institutional reality. Searle focuses on the political powers that exist within these systems of status functions and the way in which language constitutes them.<br><br>Searle argues that consciousness and rationality are crucial to our existence and that they are the result of the biological evolution of our species. He addresses the problem of free will within the context of a neurobiological conception of consciousness and rationality, and he addresses the problem of political power within the context of this analysis. <br><br>A clear and concise contribution to the free-will debate and the study of cognition, <i>Freedom and Neurobiology</i> is essential reading for students and scholars of the philosophy of mind.</p><p>In <i>Freedom and Neurobiology</i>, John Searle discusses the possibility of free will within the context of contemporary neurobiology.

In the second half of the book, Searle applies his theory of social reality to the problem of political power, explaining the role of language in the formation of our political reality. Searle focuses on the institutional structures that organize, empower, and regulate our lives-money, property, marriage, government-and the way in which language constitutes them. He argues that consciousness and rationality are crucial to our existence and that they are the result of the biological evolution of our species. In conclusion, he addresses the problem of free will within the context of a neurobiological conception of consciousness and rationality, and he addresses the problem of political power within the context of this analysis.John Searle is Slusser Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley.

The four chapters presented form the core of Bodin&#39;s classic work, Six Livres de la Republique. Bodin was primarily responsible for introducing the seductive but erroneous notion that sovereignty is indivisible, that the entire power of the state had to be vested in a single individual or group. This thesis, combined with the prevailing crisis of authority during the French religious wars, led Bodin to a systematically absolutist interpretation of the French and other European monarchies. This is the first complete translation of this material into English since 1606, and is accompanied by a lucid introduction, chronology, and bibliography.</p><p>Bodin introduced the erroneous notion of indivisible sovereignty which led to an absolutist interpretation of the French and other European monarchies.

A Savage Conflict is the first work to treat guerrilla warfare as critical to understanding the course and outcome of the Civil War. Daniel Sutherland argues that irregular warfare took a large toll on the Confederate war effort by weakening support for state and national governments and diminishing the trust citizens had in their officials to protect them. Sutherland points out that early in the war Confederate military and political leaders embraced guerrilla tactics. They knew that &#34;partizan&#34; fighters had helped to win the American Revolution. As the war dragged on and defense of the remote spaces of the Confederate territory became more tenuous, guerrilla activity spiraled out of state control. It was adopted by parties who had interests other than Confederate victory, including southern Unionists, violent bands of</p><p>"Scholarly attention to guerrilla activity during the Civil War has expanded dramatically in recent years, with Dan Sutherland leading the charge. <i>A Savage Conflict</i> is a culmination of that good work, in which Sutherland makes the fullest and most compelling case yet for the pervasiveness of irregular warfare, for the many forms it took and the forces that drove it, and for its considerable impact on the course of the war, both militarily and on the home front. It's a masterful study and a major contribution to our understanding of the internal divisiveness that characterized this most uncivil of civil wars."--John C.

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.

And then . . . Cats and Les Miz. Mark Steyn&#39;s Broadway Babies Say Goodnight is a sharp-eyed view of the whole span of Broadway musical history, seven decades of brilliant achievements the best of which are among the finest works American artists have made. Show Boat, Oklahoma!, Carousel, Gypsy, and more. In an energetic blend of musical history, analysis, and backstage chat, Mark Steyn shows us the genius behind the &#39;simple&#39; musical, and asks hard questions about the British invasion of Broadway and the future of the form. In this delicious book he gives us geniuses and monsters, hits and atomic bombs, and the wonderful stories that prove show business is a business which -- as the song goes --there&#39;s no business like.</p><p><strong>Mark Steyn</strong> is a columnist for Britain's <em>Daily Telegraph</em> and Canada's <em>National Post</em>.

A Canadian citizen, he lives in New Hampshire and Qu�bec.Is Broadway musical theater in terminal decline, fed intravenously from London, in headlong retreat to operetta certainties, emotional platitudes and vapidly luxuriant tunes? Almost, but not quite, suggests Steyn in this delightful, irreverent romp through seven decades of American musical theater from Show Boat to Miss Saigon. Taking the pulse of the Great White Way as a theater critic, he finds that Broadway shows have become amorphous creatures, products of the shifting interests of agglomerations of co-producers, fund-raisers, theater owners and provincial tour bookers. His breezy yet substantial surveya spontaneous mix of vibrant history, juicy gossip, plot and song analysis and pungent criticismloses its fizz about halfway through, yet it is filled with gimlet insights into the craft and business of musicals and valuable close-ups of old-timers (Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Rodgers and Hart and Hammerstein, novelist/lyricist P.G. Wodehouse, the Gershwins, Damn Yankees creator George Abbott, etc.) as well as more recent figures (such as producer David Merrick and choreographer/directors Bob Fosse and Michael Bennett). Separate in-depth chapters cover the massive creative contributions of Jews and gays to the Broadway musical; other chapters offer a scathing look at British musicals and skewer rock musicals from Hair to Rent. Along the way, Steyn memorably tweaks Andrew Lloyd Weber (a classic example of imperial overstretch), Stephen Sondheim and others. With encyclopedic knowledge and unabashed passion for the best of Broadway, Steyn explains how an art form has embedded itself into our cultural vocabulary. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Emma (Norton Critical Editions)</h2><p><p><strong>The text reprinted in this new edition of Austen&#x2019;s comedic novel is based on the 1816 text, which has been carefully edited in light of later editions, including the Chapman edition.</strong></p> "Backgrounds" supplies an abundance of documents that shed light on Austen's life and reveal some of her private attitudes toward her writing.<br><br> "Reviews and Criticism" presents a wide variety of perspectives, both contemporary and recent, including essays by Sir Walter Scott, Henry James, A. C. Bradley, E. M. Forster, Robert Alan Donovan, Marilyn Butler, Mary Poovey, Claudia Johnson, Juliet McMaster, Ian Watt, and Suzanne Juhasz.&nbsp; New to this edition are essays by Maggie Lane, Edward Copeland, and Linda Troost and Sayre Greenfield, the last of which discusses film adaptations of <em>Emma</em>.<br><br> A Chronology and Selected Bibliography are included.</p><p>Of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is the most flawed, the most infuriating, and, in the end, the most endearing. <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>'s Lizzie Bennet has more wit and sparkle; Catherine Morland in <i> Northanger Abbey</i> more imagination; and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>'s Elinor Dashwood certainly more sense--but Emma is lovable precisely because she is so imperfect. Austen only completed six novels in her lifetime, of which five feature young women whose chances for making a good marriage depend greatly on financial issues, and whose prospects if they fail are rather grim. <i>Emma</i> is the exception: "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." One may be tempted to wonder what Austen could possibly find to say about so fortunate a character. The answer is, quite a lot. <p> For Emma, raised to think well of herself, has <i>such</i> a high opinion of her own worth that it blinds her to the opinions of others. The story revolves around a comedy of errors: Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, and attempts to remake her in her own image. Ignoring the gaping difference in their respective fortunes and stations in life, Emma convinces herself and her friend that Harriet should look as high as Emma herself might for a husband--and she zeroes in on an ambitious vicar as the perfect match. At the same time, she reads too much into a flirtation with Frank Churchill, the newly arrived son of family friends, <i>and</i> thoughtlessly starts a rumor about poor but beautiful Jane Fairfax, the beloved niece of two genteelly impoverished elderly ladies in the village. As Emma's fantastically misguided schemes threaten to surge out of control, the voice of reason is provided by Mr. Knightly, the Woodhouse's longtime friend and neighbor. Though Austen herself described Emma as "a heroine whom no one but myself will much like," she endowed her creation with enough charm to see her through her most egregious behavior, and the saving grace of being able to learn from her mistakes. By the end of the novel Harriet, Frank, and Jane are all properly accounted for, Emma is wiser (though certainly not sadder), and the reader has had the satisfaction of enjoying Jane Austen at the height of her powers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Emma is Austen&#39;s most technically accomplished novel, with a hidden plot, the full implications of which are only revealed by a second reading. The text presented here retains the spelling and punctuation of the first edition of 1816, allowing readers to see the novel as Austen&#39;s contemporaries first encountered it. The volume provides comprehensive explanatory notes, an extensive critical introduction, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual apparatus. This edition is an indispensable resource for all scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>Insights on Acts (Swindoll&#39;s Living Insights New Testament Commentary)</h2><p><i>Insights on Acts</i> explores the expansion of the early church throughout the Roman world in the continuing 15-volume Swindoll&#x2019;s Living Insights New Testament Commentary series.

The newly updated volumes now include parallel presentations of the NLT and NASB before each section. This series is a must-have for pastors, teachers, and anyone else who is seeking a deeply practical resource for exploring God&#x2019;s Word.</p><p>Luke&#x2019;s second volume is a book of transitions, documenting the period after the earthly ministry of Jesus, an era like no other in history, a time when God had much to say but spoke less through individual prophets and more through a growing, Spirit-filled community. Throughout this narrative, Luke shows the church challenged, the church guided by the Holy Spirit, and the church triumphant.<br><br>I would state Luke&#x2019;s purpose this way: to demonstrate, from the facts of history, that the church has become God&#x2019;s instrument for stewarding the new covenant, that the church is guided by His Spirit, and that nothing can prevent Christ from building His church. Acts opens with a question about the kingdom of God and Christ&#x2019;s commissioning and empowering of the church, and it closes with the assurance that, even under arrest in Rome, Paul continued &#x201c;preaching the kingdom of God . . . unhin-dered&#x201d; (Acts 28:31).Charles R.

The Atlas contains 89 color maps some political, some thematic which are arranged chronologically and accompanied by extensive text and numerous tables. The bibliography is thorough. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>Paul Robert Magocsi is professor of history and political science at the University of Toronto.Much in the news recently for radical political and social changes, East Central Europe has known tumult and change for centuries. The stasis the Cold War brought to borders and political systems was an uncharacteristic period of calm. This atlas, the keystone volume in an ongoing 10-volume scholarly history of the region, charts and summarizes changes from the fifth century through 1992.<p>For the purposes of this atlas, the limits of East Central Europe have been defined as "toward the west, the eastern part of Germany (historic Mecklenburg, Brandenburg, Prussia, Saxony, and Lusatia), Bavaria, Austria, and northeastern Italy (historic Venetia), and toward the east, the lands of historic Poland-Lithuania (present-day Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine up to the Dnieper River), Moldova, and western Anatolia in Turkey." Nothing is simple in this region, including place-names. As postwar treaties have moved borders back and forth, and as kingdoms, empires, and republics have risen and fallen, place-names have changed depending upon which group held power at a given time. The editors have settled on the principle of using the same name for a town or city on every map regardless of usage at the time depicted on the map or latter-day revisionist desires. The name used is based on present-day political boundaries. This is supplemented by providing "in parentheses below the main entry, as many alternate historical names as space would allow."</p><p>The 89 color maps are arranged in chronological order. Scales vary, but most maps show East Central Europe whole or a substantial portion of it. Legends appropriate to each map are clearly labeled, as are the maps themselves. Substantial interpretive text--a full page or more--accompanies each map. The text enjoys the same clarity as the map it explains. Useful tables (e.g., dates various states declared war on each other from 1914 to 1917, the ethnolinguistic-national composition of Yugoslavia) are imbedded in the text. In addition to showing the state of the entire region at key points in its history, the maps depict religious trends, wars, migrations, population levels, economic developments, and individual countries. Sources for each map are listed in an appendix. They are cited by a section letter and author's name, which refer to items in the extensive four-part bibliography that follows.</p><p>All of this information is accessible through a detailed table of contents and a thorough index that cites places, peoples, events, and topics and differentiates between references to text and maps. Bracketed abbreviations follow many place-names in the index to indicate which of 26 languages they derive from.</p><p>No comparable source in English exists. Adams's <i>Atlas of Russian and East European History</i> (Praeger, 1966) focuses on Russia. Furthermore, it necessarily misses recent developments, and its black-and-white maps are rudimentary in comparison.

The gospel narratives of the Passion cast the Jews as responsible, directly and indirectly, for the death of the Son of God. The stigma of "Christ killer"-the notion that all Jews, at all times and in all places, share in the collective responsibility for the Crucifixion-has plagued Jews ever since and is the source of much Christian anti-Semitism.<br> Jeremy Cohen traces the Christ-killer myth from ancient times to the present day, touching on the Gospels and their roots in Hebrew Scripture, Mel Gibson's <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>, and much in between. The greatest of the church fathers, the Crusades, the notorious blood libels of the Middle Ages, the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, Christian mysticism, art, and popular piety, Passion plays, and modern film all have a place in this well-documented, richly illustrated volume.<br> Cohen seeks neither to explain Jesus' death nor to pass judgment on anyone for it, but rather to understand how the identification of Jews as Christ killers has functioned as an edifying "myth" for the Christian community. His insightful analysis reveals the deep spiritual truth believers find in this aspect of the Passion story while simultaneously uncovering the remarkably far-reaching impact it has exercised on the Western world.<br> Cohen combines religious, historical, and political perspectives to understand how the Christ-killer myth has become a dominant factor in the way Christians and Jews perceive each other. While a great deal has been written about Christian anti-Semitism, its roots, and its horrific consequences, this is the first volume to provide an in-depth examination of the powerful story that has fueled the fires behind the hatred.<br></p><p><br>Three-time winner of the National Jewish Book Award, Jeremy Cohen has written extensively on the encounter between Jews and Christians, among his books are <em>The Friars and the Jews: The Evolution of Medieval Anti-Judaism</em> and <em>Living Letters of the Law: Ideas of the Jew in Medieval Christianity</em>. He has taught Jewish history at Cornell University, The Ohio State University, and, most recently, at Tel Aviv University.<br><br>"Cohen offers readers a lucid and sophisticated understanding of the age-old phenomenon of anti-Semitism. From its earliest history to Mel Gibson, Cohen explores the issues which have allowed this hateful notion to persist. It is a book which is fascinating, frightening, and important. It will be of interest to both the specialist and the lay reader." -- Deborah E. Lipstadt, author of History on Trial: My Day in Court with David Irving<p></p><br>"Jeremy Cohen shows exactly how the Christ-killer charge lodged, like a killer-virus, in the imagination of the West. Alas, he shows, also, how it remains a mortal problem for Christians, a threat to Jews -- a germ of further hatred. Meticulous truth-telling like Cohen's is the only antidote to this ancient plague." -- James Carroll, author of Constantine's Sword and House of War<p></p><br>"It would be hard to think of a more consequential myth in western history than that of the Jews as killers of Christ. Jeremy Cohen offers a highly readable examination of the myth from its inception almost two thousand years ago to its continued potent effects today. Replete with dozens of dramatic pictorial representations and making use of the latest scholarly research, <em>Christ Killers</em> offers absorbing, if chilling, reading." David I. Kertzer, author of The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara and The Popes Against the Jews<p></p><br>"<em>Christ Killers</em> is a gripping account of a myth that has profoundly shaped Christian-Jewish relations for two thousand years. Jeremy Cohen's command of the subject--from the Gospels to Mel's Gibson's Passion--is magisterial." --James Shapiro, author of <em>Shakespeare and the Jews</em> and <em>Oberammergau</em><p></p><br>"Even-handedly and with remarkable erudition, Cohen focuses on successive versions of the story in a great variety of literary and artistic forms, contemplating their effects on believers as well as on the Jews adn Judaism demonized in the Passion narrative. ...An important book, accessible to general readers."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"An intriguing and succinct introduction to the tragic and sobering history of anti-Judaism and anti-Semitism from its beginnings to the present. ...a lively and accessible account, fascinating to a general audience and highly useful to specialists. ...Cohen reminds the reader throughout his book of other ways to read Christian texts, of biblical, theological, and historical approaches that ultimately clear the Jewish people of the Christ-killer accusation. This multitude of voices, made audible by Cohen, is one great contribution of his work." --<em>Church History</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Fernando Pessoa &amp; Co.: Selected Poems</h2><p>Fernando Pessoa (1888-1935) - a poet who lived most his life in Lisbon, Portugal, and who died in obscurity there - has in recent years gained international recognition as one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century.

Massive changes in the technology of reproduction took place, and France in particular became a leading testing ground for new printing and photographic techniques. This abundantly illustrated book investigates for the first time the complex and lively interactions between painting, printmaking, and photography in France during the 1800s. Cultural historian Stephen Bann explores why rising reproductive media did not supplant traditional modes and how, instead, printmakers, photographers, and painters influenced and inspired each other&#39;s work, together creating a visual culture of unique richness and breadth. The book focuses especially on pictorial reproduction involving painting, printmaking, and photography in combination. Bann includes in the discussion the interweaving careers of Ingres and such contemporary painters as Vernet and Delaroche, such printmakers as lithographer Nicolas Charlet and engraver Luigi Calamatta, and such pioneering photographers as Ni�pce, Daguerre, and Robert Bingham. Setting the nineteenth-century issues of reproduction in the context of art history and theory, Bann also offers insights into the nature of art reproduction in our own era of radically changing reproduction technology.</p><p>Stephen Bann is professor of history of art at the University of Bristol, England and the author of several books on nineteenth-century France.</p><h2>Handbook on Japanese Military Forces</h2><p>A manual on the wartime Japanese military, published in 1944 by the US Army for its officers in the Pacific, as an expanded version of the original 1942 manual of the same name.

Such a system was developed independently by Bolyai in Hungary and Lobatschewsky in Russia, about 120 years ago. Another system, differing more radically from Euclid&#39;s, was suggested later by Riemann in Germany and Cayley in England. The subject was unified in 1871 by Klein, who gave the names of parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptic to the respective systems of Euclid-Bolyai-Lobatschewsky, and Riemann-Cayley. Since then, a vast literature has accumulated. The Fifth edition adds a new chapter, which includes a description of the two families of &#39;mid-lines&#39; between two given lines, an elementary derivation of the basic formulae of spherical trigonometry and hyperbolic trigonometry, a computation of the Gaussian curvature of the elliptic and hyperbolic planes, and a proof of Schlafli&#39;s remarkable formula for the differential of the volume of a tetrahedron.</p><p>A reissue of Professor Coxeter&#39;s classic text on non-Euclidean geometry.

J. Habraken, intimate and unceasing interaction between people and the forms they inhabit uniquely defines built environment. <i>The Structure of the Ordinary</i>, the culmination of decades of environmental observation and design research, is a recognition and analysis of everyday environment as the wellspring of urban design and formal architecture. The author's central argument is that built environment is universally organized by the Orders of Form, Place, and Understanding. These three fundamental, interwoven principles correspond roughly to physical, biological, and social domains.</p><p>Historically, "ordinary" environment was the background against which architects built the "extraordinary." Drawing upon extensive examples from archaeological and contemporary sites worldwide, the author illustrates profound recent shifts in the structure of everyday environment. One effect of these transformations, Habraken argues, has been the loss of implicit common understanding that previously enabled architects to formally enhance and innovate while still maintaining environmental coherence. Consequently, architects must now undertake a study of the ordinary as the fertile common ground in which form- and place-making are rooted. In focusing on built environment as an autonomous entity distinct from the societies and natural environments that jointly create it, this book lays the foundation for a new dialogue on methodology and pedagogy, in support of a more informed approach to professional intervention.</p></p><p>N.

The bitter war that followed ended in an American victory. Peace, of course, raised as many questions of government as it answered. A plan of government is a plan for distribution of the power and wealth of a society. The choice of system, then, is no idle exercise in political theory. How to plan the new American government was the major policy issue of the late 18th century. The first grand scheme was embodied in the Articles of Confederation. It proved unsatisfactory to powerful circles in the country. After the failure of the Articles, a federal Constitution was drawn up, and ratified in 1787. </p><p> Each colony, too, underwent its own revolution. Colonies became states, and embarked on new courses of action with new problems and new programs. First, they had to fight a war and patch up domestic disruptions. All this called for a major outburst of lawmaking. In Pennsylvania, for example, a constitutional convention, in 1776, declared a general amnesty and established a new form of government. Old officials were replaced by men loyal to the Revolution. The ordinary business of government was to continue, where possible; and the emergencies of war had to be coped with. In October 1777, British troops "penetrated into [the] state, and after much devastation and great cruelty in their progress," seized Philadelphia; the state government then created a "council of safety," with vast and summary powers "to promote and provide for the preservation of the Commonwealth." It had power to seize goods "for the army and for the inhabitants," punish traitors, and "regulate the prices of such articles as they may think necessary." But the "ordinary course of justice" was to continue as far as feasible. In the same year, the legislature passed a bill of attainder against a number of men who had "traitorously and wickedly" gone over to the king. The state redefined and punished treason, declared bills of credit of the Continental Congress and the state to be legal tender; and, inevitably, legislated about the militia, army supplies, taxes, and the policy of war. </p><p> When the war ended, debates over law continued. The king of England and his government had been successfully overthrown. Should the king's law be also overthrown? Should ordinary private law be radically altered? The first generation seriously argued the question. The common law was badly tarnished; so was the reputation of the lawyers, many of whom had been Tories. It seemed to some men that new democratic states needed new institutions, from top to bottom, including fresh, democratic law. A pamphleteer, who called himself Honestus, asked, in 1786: "Can the monarchical and aristocratical institutions of England be consistent with...republican principles?" It was "melancholy" to see the "numerous volumes" of English law, "brought into our Courts, arranged in formidable order, as the grand artillery to batter down every plain, rational principle of law." Thomas Paine, an old firebrand, spoke for at least some zealots when he denounced, in 1805, the "chicanery of law and lawyers." He complained that Pennsylvania courts, even at that late date, had "not yet arrived at the dignity of independence." The courts, he said, still "hobble along by the stilts and crutches of English and antiquated precedents," which were often not democratic at all, but "tyrrannical." During Shays's Rebellion, in Massachusetts (1786), mobs stopped the courts from sitting, and forcibly staved off execution of judgments against debtors. It was easy to attribute class bias to the courts, and attribute this class bias in turn to the antiquated, oppressive, inappropriate common law. </p><p> There were two apparent alternatives to the stilts and crutches. The common law could be replaced by some rival system. Or all systems could be abandoned in favor of natural principles of justice. The first alternative had some slight basis, in hope if not in fact. There <i>were</i> other systems of law. After the French revolution, American liberals were particularly attracted to the French civil law. In the early 19th century, the Napoleonic Code served as a symbol and model of clarity and order. Some civil-law jurists were translated into English during this period: <i>A Treatise on Obligations, Considered in a Moral and Legal View,</i> "translated from the French of [Robert] Pothier," appeared in New Bern, North Carolina, in 1802. To some small extent, French scholars influenced American legal thought. Compared to civil law, common law seemed, to a number of jurists, to be feudal, barbaric, uncouth. </p><p> In hindsight, the common law had little to fear. It was as little threatened as the English language. The courts continued to operate, continued to do business; they used the only law that they knew. Few lawyers had any grasp of French. French lawbooks were rare and inaccessible; English authorities flooded the country. To be sure, there were some American jurists who had the education and skill to handle Continental law -- James Kent of New York, for example. Joseph Story, who served on the Supreme Court, was a tower of erudition. These men cited and used bits of foreign law in their writings and opinions. But they were not revolutionaries. They believed in purifying and improving the law, not in overthrowing it. They were willing to snatch doctrines and ideas from Continental Europe; but even English law did that. One of the culture heroes of the American legal elite was England's Lord Mansfield, who died in 1793. Mansfield was Scottish by birth and an ardent admirer of Roman-flavored civil law. </p><p> And of course the common law had many defenders. Not everybody saw the common law as old and despotic. It was also the birthright of free men, a precious inheritance, perverted by the British under George III, but still a vital reality. One rhetorical pillar of the men of 1776 was that the common law embodied fundamental norms of natural law. The first Continental Congress, in 1776, adopted a Declaration of Rights; it declared that the colonies were "entitled to the common law of England," in particular the right of trial by jury. Americans were also entitled to the benefit of those English statutes which "existed at the time of colonization; and which they have, by experience, respectively found to be applicable to their several local and other circumstances." </p><p> Common-law lawyers were among the heroes of the Republic. John Adams was one; Thomas Jefferson, for all his ambivalence toward common law and its judges, another. Lawyers mostly drafted the state and federal constitutions. Courts were increasingly manned by lawyers, who listened to the arguments of other lawyers. Lawyers moved west with the line of settlement; they swarmed into state capitals and county seats. Wherever one looked in political life -- in town, city, county, state, and national government -- the lawyers were there. Unlike some later revolutions, and some earlier colonial Utopias, the new republic did not try to do business without lawyers. Old lawyers continued to function, training new lawyers in their image, who, like their teachers, turned almost instinctively to common law. The common law was also a weapon of integration. The Northwest Ordinance imposed common law on the lands of the American frontier. In the prairies and forests, where French settlers lived and worked in the path of the American onrush, the common law was an agent of American imperialism. </p><p> The common law would have to be Americanized, of course. Now that the states had freedom to choose, what parts of English law would remain in force? This was a tortuous question, not easily solved. Many states passed statutes to define the limits of the law in force. A Virginia law of 1776 declared that the "common law of England, all statutes or acts of Parliament made in aid of the common law prior to the fourth year of the reign of King James the first, and which are of a general nature, not local to that kingdom...shall be considered as in full force." The Delaware constitution of 1776 (art. 25) provided that "The common law of England as well as so much of the statute law as has been heretofore adopted in practice in this State, shall remain in force," except for those parts which were "repugnant to the rights and privileges" expressed in the constitution and in the "declaration of rights." </p><p> The New York experience was particularly complex. A law of 1786 declared the common law in force, and such English statutes as were in effect in the colony on April 19, 1775. Later, New York specifically re-enacted some British laws -- the Statute of Frauds, for example, a law first passed in 1677, and which had virtually become a part of the common law. In 1788, a New York law, "for the Amendment of the Law, and the better Advancement of Justice," declared that "after the <i>first</i> day of <i>May</i> next," no British statutes "shall operate or be considered as Laws" in the state. The New York Constitution of 1821 (art. VII, sec. 13) stated that "Such parts of the common law, and of the acts of the legislature of the colony of New York, as together did form the law of the said colony" on April 19, 1775, and the resolutions of the colonial Congress, "and of the convention of the State of New York," in force on April 20, 1777, would continue to be law, unless altered or repealed, and unless they were "repugnant" to the constitution. No mention was made of British statutes; for good measure, an act of 1828 specifically pronounced the British statutes dead. </p><p> Yet even this flock of New York laws fell short of solving the problem. A New York court later held that some English statutes had become part of the "common law" of the colony. This meant that an undefinable, unknowable group of old laws somehow maintained a ghostly presence. They lived on, of course, only insofar as they were not "repugnant" to the constitution or unsuitable to conditions. One could never, then, be sure if an old law were dead or alive. New York was not the only state whose judges held that some of the old statutes were valid, and thus sentenced the legal public to a certain amount of uncertainty. To this day, an occasional case still turns on whether some statute or doctrine had been "received" as common law in this or that state. The question of "reception" had troubled the colonials too. Independence merely altered the form of the question. And in a broader sense, the question is an abiding one in all common-law jurisdictions. Judges must constantly re-examine the law, to see which parts still suit society's needs, and which parts must be thrown on the ash heap, once and for all. </p><p> The reception statutes dealt with the <i>older</i> English law. What about new law? There was, as expected, a strong burst of national pride. To Jesse Root of Connecticut, writing in 1798, it was "unnecessary, and derogatory" for courts of an independent nation to be governed by foreign law. His ideal was "the republic of bees," whose members "resist all foreign influence with their lives," and whose honey, "though extracted from innumerable flowers," was indisputably their own. In pursuit of the republic of bees, New Jersey passed a law, in 1799, that </p><p> no adjudication, decision, or opinion, made, had, or given, in any court of law or equity in Great Britain [after July 4, 1776]...nor any printed or written report or statement thereof, nor any compilation, commentary, digest, lecture, treatise, or other explanation or exposition of the common law,...shall be received or read in any court of law or equity in this state, as law or evidence of the law, or elucidation or explanation thereof. </p><p> Kentucky prohibited the mere mention of recent British law. Its statute, passed in 1807, declared that "reports and books containing adjudged cases in...Great Britain...since the 4th day of July 1776, shall not be read or considered as authority in...the courts of this Commonwealth." During Spring Term, 1808, Henry Clay, appearing before the court of appeals of Kentucky, "offered to read" a "part of Lord Ellenborough's opinion" in Volume 3 of East's reports; the "chief justice stopped him." Clay's co-counsel argued that the legislature "had no more power to pass" such a law than to "prohibit a judge the use of his spectacles." The court decided, however, that "the book must not be used at all in court." </p><p> But Lord Ellenborough was not so easily banished, in New Jersey, or Kentucky, or elsewhere. The New Jersey statute was repealed in 1819. As a practical matter, English law continued to be used by lawyers and courts, throughout the period, throughout the country. England remained the basic source of all law that was not strictly new or strictly American. The habits of a lifetime were not easily thrown over, despite ideology. Indigenous legal literature was weak and derivative. There was no general habit of publishing American decisions; American case reports were not common until a generation or more after Independence. To common-law lawyers, a shortage of cases was crippling. To fill the gap, English materials were used, English reports cited, English judges quoted as authority. In the first generation, more English than American cases were cited in American reports. Ordinary lawyers referred to Blackstone constantly; they used his book as a shortcut to the law; and Blackstone was English to the core. Sometimes curiously old-fashioned bits of law -- phrases, old doctrines, old writs -- turned up in curious places (for example, the American frontier); the reason was the ubiquity of Blackstone. </p><p> American law continued, in short, to borrow. The English overlay was obvious, pervasive -- but selective. The English doctrines that were invited to this country were those which were needed and wanted -- and only those. Sweeping changes took place in American law in the years between 1776 and the middle of the 19th century. During that time, there developed a true republic of bees, whose flowers were the social and economic institutions that developed in their own way in the country. They, not Lord Ellenborough and Lord Kenyon, were the lawmakers that made American law a distinctive system: a separate language of law within the family founded in England. </p><p> The second apparent alternative to the common law was also a mirage. To abolish the tyranny of lawyers and their rules, to reduce law to a common-sense system, at the level of the common man's understanding, a system of simple, "natural" justice: this was an age-old yearning, but it flared up with special vigor after 1776. As one citizen of Kentucky put it, the state needed "a simple and concise code of laws...adopted to the weakest capacity." </p><p> In part, the antilaw movement was an outgrowth of radical politics. One current of thought distrusted the common law on the grounds that it was remote from the needs of ordinary people, and was biased toward the rich. Another current of thought distrusted the law because it was archaic, inflexible, irrelevant; it did not suit the needs of merchant or businessman. Both groups could make common cause against lawyers' law, which suited nobody's wants but the lawyers. There was a general interest, then, in a reform of legal institutions, in which ...</p></p><h2>Problems in Ancient History, Vol. 1: The Ancient Near East and Greece</h2><p>Selected ancient sources in translation and modern commentaries provide a survey of major problems in ancient history from Sumeria to the late Roman Empire and offer insight into historical methods and techniques.</p><p></p><h2>The Experience of God: Being, Consciousness, Bliss</h2><p>Despite the recent ferocious public debate about belief, the concept most central to the discussion God frequently remains vaguely and obscurely described. Are those engaged in these arguments even talking about the same thing? In a wide-ranging response to this confusion, esteemed scholar David Bentley Hart pursues a clarification of how the word God&#x201d; functions in the world&#x2019;s great theistic faiths.<br> <br> Ranging broadly across Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Vedantic and Bhaktic Hinduism, Sikhism, and Buddhism, Hart explores how these great intellectual traditions treat humanity&#x2019;s knowledge of the divine mysteries. Constructing his argument around three principal metaphysical moments&#x201d; being, consciousness, and bliss the author demonstrates an essential continuity between our fundamental experience of reality and the ultimate reality to which that experience inevitably points.<br> <br> Thoroughly dismissing such blatant misconceptions as the deists' concept of God, as well as the fundamentalist view of the Bible as an objective historical record, Hart provides a welcome antidote to simplistic manifestoes. In doing so, he plumbs the depths of humanity&#x2019;s experience of the world as powerful evidence for the reality of God and captures the beauty and poetry of traditional reflection upon the divine.</p><p>Praise for David Bentley Hart&#x2019;s <i>Atheist Delusions</i><br> &nbsp;<br> [A] major work by one of the most learned, forceful, and witty Christian theologians currently writing.&#x201d; <i>First Things</i><br> &nbsp;<br> With impressive erudition and polemical panache, David Hart smites hip and thigh the peddlers of a new atheism&#x2019; that recycles hoary arguments from the past.

In <i>C�zanne's Other: The Portraits of Hortense</i>, Susan Sidlauskas breaks new ground, focusing on these paintings as a group and looking particularly at the differences that render many of them unrecognizable as the same person. She argues that C�zanne sidestepped the conventional goals of portraiture-he avoids representing a consistent, identifiable physiognomy or conventional feminine postures and does not portray the subject's inner life-making lack of fixedness itself his subject, which leads him ultimately to a radical reformulation of modern portraiture. Sidlauskas also upends the notion of Mme C�zanne as the irrelevant and absent spouse. Instead she reveals Hortense Fiquet C�zanne as a presence so crucial to the artist that she became the essential &#x201c;other&#x201d; to his ever-evolving &#x201c;self.&#x201d; Coupling historical texts from philosophy, psychology, and physiology with more recent writings from women's and gender studies, cognitive psychology, and visual culture, Sidlauskas demonstrates that Mme C�zanne offered intimacy at arm's length for the painter who has been dubbed &#x201c;the lone wolf of Aix.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Susan Sidlauskas assesses a massive body of contextual information, coordinating it with her original observations. She has mastered both the general and the specific about C�zanne. Through her sustained attention to the artist's portraits of his wife, she expands our sense of his practice as well as his emotional life. Perhaps most importantly, she gives us insights into new ways of perceiving and depicting, ways nevertheless consistent with C�zanne's world. Her passages of description are remarkable, sometimes breathtaking: Everyone interested in painting should read them.&#x201d;&#x2015;Richard Shiff, Effie Marie Cain Regents Chair in Art, The University of Texas at Austin<br><br>&#x201c;Susan Sidlauskas's <i>C�zanne's Other</i> is a brilliant and original study of the artist's series of representations of his wife, Hortense Fiquet. Rejecting clich�d arguments about 'depersonalization,' Sidlauskas affirms human idiosyncrasy and uniqueness through the potency of pictorial invention. Sidlauskas's study, both incisive and wide-ranging, makes us re-think such terms as 'resemblance,' 'recognition,' 'mimesis', and 'subjecthood' andthe entire notion of the portrait itself in relation to C�zanne's endless variations on the theme of Mme. C�zanne. This is an important addition both to C�zanne studies and the investigation of portraiture in general.&#x201d;&#x2015;Linda Nochlin, Lila Acheson Wallace Professor of Modern Art at the New York University Institute of Fine Arts<b>Susan Sidlauskas</b> is Associate Professor and Graduate Director of the Department of Art History at Rutgers University.

He was born in Baden, Switzerland, and studied chemistry at the University of Z�rich. His main interest was the chemistry of plants and animals, and he later conducted important research regarding the chemical structure of the common animal substance chitin, for which he received his doctorate. Hofmann joined the pharmaceutical-chemical department of Sandoz Laboratories (now Novartis), located in Basel, studying the medicinal plant squill and the fungus ergot as part of a program to purify and synthesize active constituents for use as pharmaceuticals.His research in lysergic acid, the central shared component of ergot alkaloids, eventually led to the synthesis of LSD-25 in 1938. It was five years later, on repeating synthesis of the almost forgotten substance, that Dr. Hofmann discovered the psychedelic effects of LSD after accidentally absorbing some through his fingertips on April 16, 1943. Three days later, on April 19 (later known as Bicycle Day, after his bicycle ride home that day while under LSD&#39;s influence), Hofmann deliberately consumed 250 micrograms of LSD, and experienced far more intense effects. This was followed by a series of self-experiments conducted by Hofmann and his colleagues. He calls LSD &#34;medicine for the soul&#34; and is frustrated by the worldwide prohibition that has pushed it underground. &#34;It was used very successfully for 10 years in psychoanalysis,&#34; he said, adding that the drug was hijacked by the youth movement of the 1960s and then unfairly demonized by the establishment that the movement opposed. He concedes LSD can be dangerous in the wrong hands. He has been the author of over 100 scientific articles and has written (or co-written) a number of books, including LSD, My Problem Child, which is partly an autobiography and describes his famous bicycle ride.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>School Zone - Multiplication &amp; Division Workbook - 32 Pages, Ages 8 to 10, 3rd Grade, 4th Grade, Estimation, Word Problems, and More (School Zone I Know It!� Workbook Series)</h2><p><p>Find our complete line of educational resources at Amazon.com/SchoolZonePublishing.</p> <p><strong>BOOK FEATURES</strong></p> <ul> <li>32 pages: 30 activity pages, 2 answer key pages</li> <li>For ages 8 to 10</li> <li>7.75" x 10.75" pages with durable glossy cover</li> <li>Book features multiple skills: Multiplication, Word Problems, Estimation, Division, and More</li> <li>Clear examples and step-by-step instructions make it easy for kids to work at their own pace</li> <li>Perforated pages are easy to tear out for individual worksheets</li> </ul> <p><strong>AMAZING</strong> - Add fun and adventure to factors and quotients.

And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents.

Villainy, schemes, and deceit threatens to darken the brilliant humor and sparkling wordplay--but the hilarious counterplot of a warring couple, Beatrice and Benedick, steals the scene as the two are finally tricked into admitting their love for each other in Shakespeare&#39;s superb comedy of manners.</p><p>This is the first edition of Much Ado About Nothing focusing wholly on the play in performance. Shifting trends in the production of this popular drama are analysed in relation to the culture of each period since Shakespeare&#39;s time, with particular attention to gender issues.

From the moment he unleashed his stripped-down, declarative sentences on the world, he began breeding entire generations of miniature Hemingways, who latched on to his subtractive style without ever wondering what he'd removed, or why. And his tendency to lapse into self-parody during the latter half of his career didn't help matters. But <i>In Our Time</i>, which Hemingway published in 1925, reminds us of just how fresh and accomplished his writing could be--and gives at least an inkling of why Ezra Pound could call him the finest prose stylist in the world.<p> In his first commercially published book (following the small-press appearance of <i>Three Stories and Ten Poems</i> in 1924), Hemingway was still wearing his influences on his sleeve. The vignettes between each story smack of Gertrude Stein, whose minimalist punctuation and clodhopping rhythms he was happy to borrow. "My Old Man" sounds like Huck Finn on the Grand Tour: "Well, we went to live at Maisons-Lafitte, where just about everybody lives except the gang at Chantilly, with a Mrs. Meyers that runs a boarding house. Maisons is about the swellest place to live I've ever seen in all my life." But in the "The Battler" or "Indian Camp" or "Big Two-Hearted River," Hemingway finds his own voice, shunning the least hint of rhetorical inflation and sticking to just the facts, ma'am. His reluctance to traffic in high-flown abstraction has often been chalked up to postwar disillusion--as though he were too much of a simpleton to make deliberate stylistic decisions. Still, nobody can read "Soldier's Home" without drawing a certain connection between the two. Returning home to Oklahoma, the hero finds that his tales of combat are now a bankrupt genre: </p><blockquote> Even his lies were not sensational at the pool room. His acquaintances, who had heard detailed accounts of German women found chained to machine guns in the Argonne forest and who could not comprehend, or were barred by their patriotism from interest in, any German machine gunners who were not chained, were not thrilled by his stories. </blockquote> If we are to believe Michael Reynolds and Ann Douglas, this passage reflects the author's own dreary homecoming as a member of the lost generation. It's also a fine example of a surprisingly rare phenomenon, at least at this point in his career: Hemingway being funny. <i>--James Marcus</i><b>Ernest Hemingway</b> ranks as the most famous of twentieth-century American writers; like Mark Twain, Hemingway is one of those rare authors most people know about, whether they have read him or not. The difference is that Twain, with his white suit, ubiquitous cigar, and easy wit, survives in the public imagination as a basically, lovable figure, while the deeply imprinted image of Hemingway as rugged and macho has been much less universally admired, for all his fame. Hemingway has been regarded less as a writer dedicated to his craft than as a man of action who happened to be afflicted with genius. When he won the Nobel Prize in 1954, <i>Time</i> magazine reported the news under Heroes rather than Books and went on to describe the author as "a globe-trotting expert on bullfights, booze, women, wars, big game hunting, deep sea fishing, and courage." Hemingway did in fact address all those subjects in his books, and he acquired his expertise through well-reported acts of participation as well as of observation; by going to all the wars of his time, hunting and fishing for great beasts, marrying four times, occasionally getting into fistfights, drinking too much, and becoming, in the end, a worldwide celebrity recognizable for his signature beard and challenging physical pursuits.</p><h2>Content Rules: How to Create Killer Blogs, Podcasts, Videos, Ebooks, Webinars (and More) That Engage Customers and Ignite Your Business (New Rules Social Media Series)</h2><p>Blogs, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and other publishing platforms are giving everyone a "voice," including organizations and their customers.

Aping their boardroom idols, the new corporate administrators at such universities wander from job to job and reductively view the students there as future workers in need of training. Obsessed with measurable successes, they stress auditing and accountability, which leads to policies of surveillance and control dubiously cloaked in the guise of scientific administration. In this eye-opening expos� of the modern university, Tuchman paints a candid portrait of the corporatization of higher education and its impact on students and faculty.&nbsp; </p><p>Like the best campus novelists, Tuchman entertains with her acidly witty observations of backstage power dynamics and faculty politics, but ultimately <i>Wannabe U</i> is a hard-hitting account of how higher education&#x2019;s misguided pursuit of success fails us all.</p></p><p><b>Gaye Tuchman</b> is professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut.

She does this with wit and wisdom, highlighting many of the tensions and contradictions of a system where every unit strives and claims to be well above average.&#x201d;</p> (Troy Duster, New York University)<br><br><p>&#x201c;In a compelling case study of Wannabe University, Gaye Tuchman thoroughly traces the metamorphosis of a university. She lays bare the combination of a managerialism focused on chasing status and a logic of compliance among divided and complicit academics that results in a comformist, transformed university.&#x201d;</p> (Gary Rhoades, general secretary of the American Association of University Professors)<br><br><p>&#x201c;<i>Wannabe U</i> is an exceptional portrait of a state university that desperately wants to play in the big leagues. Tuchman illuminates how universities have not just borrowed tools from the business world but redefined them in ways that have had a far-reaching and pernicious influence on higher education. She deftly captures the careerist ambitions of administrators and the discomfort that these transformations can cause between older faculty and newer arrivals. In the midst of these changes and conflicts, Tuchman also notes how much the day-to-day experience of faculty and students is affected. No other book is as revealing about the revolution under way in American higher education as this one.&#x201d;&#x2014;Walter W. Powell, Stanford University</p> (Walter W.

Their structures reflect the ethnic heritage of a region's settlers and the nature of the land itself. With <i>The Old Barn Book</i>, you'll be able to spot the difference between a Dutch barn and a Swedish barn, a barn for cows and a barn for tobacco. You'll find out why some barns have hipped roofs and others gables, why some have doors at the end and others have them on the side, why some are wood and some are stone, why some are round. Whether you are nostalgic for farm life or like to drive out in the country or want to join in the barn preservation movement, you will find this book an indispensable guide.</p><p>From hay barns to corn cribs, from fences to chicken coops, from silos to outhouses, &#39;The Old Barn Book&#39;s&#39; clear drawings, photos, maps, and descriptions make it easy to figure what&#39;s what around a farm.ALLEN G. NOBLE is Professor of Geography at the University of Akron and author of <i>Wood, Brick, and Stone: The North American Settlement Landscape</i>.<br><br>RICHARD K. CLEEK is Professor of Geography at the University of Wisconsin Center.</p><h2>Underdevelopment Is a State of Mind: The Latin American Case</h2><p>In this study the author offers a new way of looking at development and underdevelopment, one that explains why some countries and some ethnic groups do better than others. After 20 years of working on Latin America&#39;s development problems, the author is convinced that it is the way Latin Americans see the world that principally explains why Latin America is underdeveloped and unstable, with its wealth and land so inequitably distributed. The book challenges a conventional wisdom, subscribed to around the world, that blames the rich countries for the poverty of the poor countries.</p><p></p><h2>How Doctors Think: Clinical Judgment and the Practice of Medicine</h2><p><em>How Doctors Think</em> defines the nature and importance of clinical judgment. Although physicians make use of science, this book argues that medicine is not itself a science but rather an interpretive practice that relies on clinical reasoning. A physician looks at the patient's history along with the presenting physical signs and symptoms and juxtaposes these with clinical experience and empirical studies to construct a tentative account of the illness. <br><em>How Doctors Think</em> is divided into four parts. Part one introduces the concept of medicine as a practice rather than a science; part two discusses the idea of causation; part three delves into the process of forming clinical judgment; and part four considers clinical judgment within the uncertain nature of medicine itself. In <em>How Doctors Think</em>, Montgomery contends that assuming medicine is strictly a science can have adverse side effects, and suggests reducing these by recognizing the vital role of clinical judgment.<br></p><p>Kathryn Montgomery is Professor of Medical Humanities and Bioethics and of Medicine, and Director, Medical Humanities and Bioethics Program, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.<br>"This is a book that will be read with pleasure by anyone interested in how medicine is done and it is a book that should be required reading for all students starting their clinical training."--<em>Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine</em><p></p><br>"Montgomery has certainly written a piece that will stimulate people to think more deeply about medical and wider health professional practice. It is a text I will recommend to students and colleagues."--<em>PsycCRITIQUES</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Philosophy of Schopenhauer</h2><p>The most comprehensive treatment in English of Schopenhauer&#39;s philosophy, this book presents a brief biography of Schopenhauer, a systematic exposition of his thought, and a critical discussion of the problems to which it gives rise and its influence on a wide range of philosophers and artists, particularly Wagner and Wittgenstein.</p><p>This is a revised and enlarged version of Bryan Magee&#39;s widely praised study of Schopenhauer, the most comprehensive book on this great philosopher. It contains a brief biography of Schopenhauer, a systematic exposition of his thought, and a critical discussion of the problems to which it gives rise and its influence on a wide range of thinkers and artists.<br>Brian Magee is a noted philosopher, writer, critic, and broadcaster. His publications include <em>Men of Ideas</em> (1982), <em>The Great Philosophers</em> (1988), and (with Martin Milligan) <em>On Blindness</em> (1995). He has held visiting fellowships at Yale and Oxford Universities, among others. He has been Honorary Senior Research Fellow in the History of Ideas at King's College, London since 1984, and he is an Honorary Fellow at Keble College, Oxford.<br></p><h2>The New Oxford Book of Victorian Verse (Oxford Books of Prose &amp; Verse)</h2><p>A great age of poetry speaks for itself in Christopher Ricks&#39;s celebrated anthology: the variety and power of Victorian verse, the innovation and creativity with which poets resisted the bad propensities of the era through which they lived. The great figures are of course strongly represented -Tennyson and Browning, Swinburne and Hopkins-but not so as to crowd out the less expected but equally rewarding facets of light verse and nonsense, of grotesque and protest. At long last justice is done to the poignant directness of &#34;the true voice of feeling&#34; from William Barnes and John Clare, through Emily Jane Bronte and Christina G. Rossetti, to Thomas Hardy.</p><p>Christopher Ricks is Warren Professor of the Humanities at Boston University and co-director of the Editorial Institute. He has taught at Boston University since 1986; he was formerly King Edward VII Professor of English Literature at the University of Cambridge.Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch's original Oxford Book of Victorian Verse (1912) reflected the end of an age in which Owen Meredith and Alexander Smith had seemed to some not unworthy of mention along with Arnold and Tennyson. Ricks's slimmer volume includes 34 poets not in "Q" but omits about 100 others. Unlike "Q" he does not let the lyric dominate. The two editors' tastes seldom agree. Ricks's Browning is almost a totally different creature from "Q's," for example. Ricks is more generous to Clough and to the Decadents, but slighting to Morris and Arnold. His substantial selections from Emily Bronte, Clare, Barnes, and Christina Rossetti reflect their increased reputations today. While general collections should all add Ricks, those retaining "Q" should dust him off and keep him available in order to represent fully Victorian verse and changing attitudes toward it. Barbara J.

Professor Coe places new emphasis on the pre-classic period and an additional chapter highlights evidence for overpopulation and deforestation as the prime causes of the catastrophic southern Maya collapse in the 9th century AD. However, the focus remains upon the classic period, with its magnificent art and architecture. In a new final chapter Professor Coe pays tribute to the six million or more contemporary Maya, guardians of so many of the ancient traditions. Michael D. Coe&#39;s many other books include &#34;Breaking the Maya Code&#34; (Thames and Hudson, 1992).</p><p><strong>Michael D. Coe</strong> is Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University. His books include <em>The Maya,Mexico, Breaking the Maya Code</em>, <em>Angkor and the Khmer Civilization</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Reading the Maya Glyphs. </em>Because of the wealth of new archaeological data and breakthroughs in the translation of hieroglyphs, Coe's updating of his classic synthesis of Maya civilization provides a valuable service to both informed lay readers and specialists wishing to apprise themselves of the current state of understanding of this most intellectually sophisticated and aesthetically refined pre-Columbian culture. Although the vast majority of the text may be found in the prior edition, the work is transformed by significant interpolations and deletions and is augmented by a new section of color plates, a useful guide for travelers, and a listing of Maya rulers. As it now stands, this refreshed and renewed little masterpiece merits a place in collections serving students of ancient Mesoamerica. Continuing a tradition of massive exhibitions and concomitant exhibition catalogs, the Palazzo Grassi, Venice, has at last discovered the New World. This initial incursion wisely focuses on the most accessible of the great pre-Hispanic cultures, the Maya. In this daunting but unfocused potpourri, some 29 essayists broach nearly the full range of Maya historical, societal, intellectual, political, and artistic traditions with varying degrees of competence. As is common with collective efforts of this sort, one finds both a certain redundancy of elementary facts and a not infrequent inconsistency about the facts themselves. Crammed into the last hundred pages of the volume is the catalog of more than 500 well-illustrated but only perfunctorily documented and analyzed objects. Aside from its value as a remarkable gathering of some 1400 excellent color reproductions, this ill-balanced and ultimately superficial tome has little to recommend it.ARobert Cahn, Fashion Inst. of Technology, New York<br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Styx&#39;s Storm (A Novel of the Breeds)</h2><p>To save innocent, young Storme Montague from the claws of Breed slave traders, Wolf Breed Styx is forced to claim her himself-on the condition that Storme will no longer be a virgin by night&#39;s end. And though Storme&#39;s defenses are up, Styx will free her-in ways she never expects.</p><p>Lora Leigh is known for her deliciously intense and satisfying erotic romance. Her characters come to her in her dreams, inspiring her with the possibilities of <i>What If...</i> Most days, Lora can be found in front of her computer weaving daydreams while sipping the ambrosia of the gods, also known as coffee. When not writing, thinking about writing, or plotting what to write, Lora, a Kentucky native, enjoys gardening, fishing, and hiking with her husband and children.<b>chapter 1</b><p>The bar was hopping, music pounding, drinks flowing smoothly and customers packing the bar area and dance floor. It was one of those country hole-in-the-walls that attracted both criminal elements as well as the upper class and everything in between. It was one of those places Storme could slide into, and her scent became masked by the dozens of sweating, lusty, alcohol-infused bodies that filled it. </p><p>It was one of the few ways to hide from paranormal senses and extrasensory capabilities. It was one of the few places Storme had a hope of resting before she had to run again. </p><p>And God knew, she was tired. Exhaustion was beginning to swamp her, desperation was clawing at her back, and fear was a companion she hadn&#x2019;t separated from in far too long. </p><p>She wanted to rest. </p><p>Was there a saying about no rest for the wicked? There was. She must have been wicked in a former life though, because this life had just been spent running. </p><p>&#x201c;Whiskey shot and a beer,&#x201d; she said wearily as the waitress came to the table. </p><p>Pulling a few of the precious bills from her pocket, she slid the money to the waitress when she returned. </p><p>She tossed back the whiskey, then chased the burn with the icy bitterness of the beer and blew out a slow, deep breath before looking around. </p><p>The band was actually pretty good here, the lead singers sultry when they needed to be, hard and filled with desperation when the song called for it. </p><p>The smell of cigarette smoke, booze, sweat and lust was so strong it didn&#x2019;t take Breed senses to detect it, Storme Montague decided as she sat in the corner of the room and watched the customers milling through the large area. A human with any sense of smell could detect it. </p><p>Moving to the corner of the booth, she hunched into the shadows and watched the crowd, knowing that even here there was danger. She had glimpsed it as she rushed inside and skirted the edge of the room to get as far away from it as possible. </p><p>From where she sat she could see the Breeds in the far corner as the crowds shifted and moved between them. There were four, and she knew all of them. Not personally, of course, but Storme knew a lot of Breeds; she&#x2019;d made it her business to learn who they were, especially when she caught them trailing her. </p><p>Navarro Blaine, and this one, she knew well from Omega. He was a Wolf Breed with Asian heritage. He was tall, dusky skinned with the exotic slant of eyes and high, flat cheekbones. Black, brown and a hint of gray filled his hair, though the gray wasn&#x2019;t from age, it was from the gray Wolf genetics he carried. He was dressed a bit more sophisticated than the three he was with. Black silk slacks, leather shoes and a white silk shirt matched with an expensive black leather jacket. </p><p>That hair was long, falling nearly to the middle of his back as his black eyes, narrowed and intense, surveyed the room. </p><p>This Breed she knew, unfortunately. He had been in Omega while she had been there with her father. If she wasn&#x2019;t mistaken, he had been one of her father&#x2019;s favorite creations. </p><p>Several times she had heard her brother refer to Navarro with worry and fondness, and several times her father had actually stated that he could have considered the Breed a son. </p><p>Her father had a daughter, but this Breed had concerned him far more than his daughter&#x2019;s safety had, and for that, Storme had once hated him with a passion. </p><p>Lawe Justice and Rule Breaker were Lion Breeds. Both men were extremely handsome, as all Breeds were, and rumored to be full brothers, perhaps even twins. Shoulder-length black hair was pulled to the napes of both men&#x2019;s necks, while powerful bodies were attired in jeans, boots, T-shirts and denim jackets. </p><p>It was the fourth one that seemed the odd Breed out. He sat back casually in his chair, one hand lying on the table, his fingers tapping to the music as he glanced at the dance floor and the women that sauntered by the table to draw the men&#x2019;s attention. </p><p>Blue eyes. Ocean blue. She could see those eyes each time she caught a glimpse of his face through the crowd. Long red hair flowed past his shoulders, coarse rather than soft, tied back at his nape as the others&#x2019; was, though it had the appearance of having been tamed only under protest. </p><p>Squared, strong features drew instant female attention, as did the exotic eyes that appeared to be lined with the faintest edge of kohl. High cheekbones, well-molded male lips, broad shoulders, a strong chest and impressive biceps. He was larger and broader than the other men, and looked exactly like what he had been created to be. A Scots warrior. He would have looked at home in a kilt with a sword strapped to his waist. </p><p>Leather pants, heavy boots, a white long-sleeved shirt and leather riding jacket were the perfect covering for him. They made him look harder, broader, more dangerous. </p><p>He was Styx Mackenzie, the one Breed she was seriously growing tired of playing games with. He had been on her ass for more than a year now, off and on, determined to track her down and force her to listen to the proposition the Breed community had for her. </p><p>She already knew the details. Protection in exchange for information. </p><p>She wanted to laugh at the thought. As though a Breed could ever protect her. They would be more inclined to tear her throat out if she displeased one of them. </p><p>A flash of memory, buried so deep that she rarely let herself remember it, had her eyes closing briefly as she fought it back.</p> <p>Her brother&#x2019;s death. The Breed ripping out his throat, the sounds of James&#x2019;s last gurgled breath and her father&#x2019;s cry of fear and pain. </p><p>They should have gone with her. They should have escaped as well rather than staying behind to destroy the last of the files they had on whatever secret project they had been involved in. That information had been more important than their lives. More important than her life, because her father entrusted her with the care of it, despite the fact that he should have realized that the Council would know exactly who he had given it to. </p><p>The Council scientists knew, and the Breeds knew, and she had been running from both for the past ten years. </p><p>She was tired of running, but there was a part of her that still refused to give up the information she had. </p><p>Glancing down at her hands, she watched as she twisted her mother&#x2019;s antique ring on her finger. The wedding band her father had given her mother had been in the Montague family for generations upon generations. The diamonds, sapphires and emeralds were family jewels, the blues and greens family colors. And Storme was now the last of the Montague line. There were no sons left to carry on the name, and there would be no daughters left to wear the ring. </p><p>The ring had been intended for James&#x2019;s wife, a wife he had never had because the danger of the job he had undertaken with his father had been too great. </p><p>Creating Breeds. </p><p>She glared across the room at the four Breeds. Monsters. Animals. She hated every damned one of them. As far as she was concerned, there was no crime greater than that of creating such farcical replications of humans and trying to convince the world they deserved to move freely among them. </p><p>Hatred swirled inside her for the loss of her father, her brother, the loss of her childhood and the dreams she had had of freedom. Dreams that had never come to fruition because each time she thought she had found peace, Breeds had managed to find her. </p><p>It didn&#x2019;t matter if they were the few Breeds still aligned with the Council or those who proclaimed to desire nothing but peace and freedom. They were all killers. They all wanted her for a reason, for the information they thought she had. </p><p>As she glared across the room, his head turned. Blue eyes, radiating amusement and warmth, met hers and locked. For the space of no more than a second, Storme felt mesmerized, locked in a circle of hatred, anger, laughter and hunger. </p><p>She had rarely looked into a Breed&#x2019;s eyes. They were too intuitive, their senses too sharp to hide from if they managed to look into your eyes. But this time, for that second as the crowd parted, his gaze held her. </p><p>Then, like an erratic school of fish, dancing bodies separated them, flowed between them, breaking the contact but leaving Storme assured that she was hidden no longer. </p><p>She came out of the booth instantly, moving along the edge of the crowd at a near run as she headed to the rest-rooms at the back of the bar. </p><p>She would hide there a few minutes then see about slipping out the back entrance of the bar. </p><p>She had to get out of there. She had rushed inside to hide, only to find the four bastards that had obviously been tailing her. She had thought, this close to Haven, the Wolf Breed sanctuary, that maybe she could rest for a few days, stay hidden, and figure out what to do next. </p><p>They were getting too close. Her hotel room had been ransacked the night before; the only reason she hadn&#x2019;t been there was that she had slipped out for fast food and walked to a nearby restaurant rather than driving. Her car had been parked in the parking lot of the hotel, and in addition to the belongings in her room being destroyed, the car had been broken into also. </p><p>There was no escape there. Until she acquired another vehicle, she was fucked. If she didn&#x2019;t get the damned Breeds off her ass, then she was fucked anyway. </p><p>As she rushed through the crowd, several couples parted at once; a path was created, then suddenly blocked as she slammed against a hard, wide chest. </p><p>Her gaze jerked up, locked. Her lips parted in shock, a shudder racing through her as warm hands gripped her shoulders lightly and canines flashed in a smile. </p><p>&#x201c;Weel now, I was goin&#x2019; for a drink, but I could be convinced to settle for a wee dance,&#x201d; he laughed. </p><p>She noticed it then. The music as it moved into a slow, dark strain of desperate love and passion unquenched. </p><p>Her hands pressed to his chest as his moved to her hips and he pulled her easily the rest of the way to the dance floor she had been moving by. </p><p>She&#x2019;d taken a scent neutralizer earlier, one of the precious last few she possessed. She prayed it worked. </p><p>She was too shocked to fight. In all her life she had never found herself this close to a Breed, in a situation so shockingly dangerous that it could destroy her world in an instant. </p><p>&#x201c;Do ye need the ladies&#x2019; room so desperately that a dance will interfere?&#x201d; he asked as she continued to stare up at him. &#x201c;Ye look as though the hounds of hell chase ye, lass. I can wait a moment or two if I must.&#x201d; </p><p>He didn&#x2019;t know who she was? Didn&#x2019;t know her scent? </p><p>She shook her head. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t expect to see Breeds here.&#x201d; The lightness of the response was desperate, and she was certain it fell far short of the casual comment she&#x2019;d intended. </p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be frightened, please.&#x201d; Sincerity suddenly marked his expression as they moved slowly to the music, more because he was leading than from her own conscious thought. </p><p>&#x201c;My friends and myself are just takin&#x2019; a break from a wee bit of business is all.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Business?&#x201d; She swallowed tightly. &#x201c;This close to Haven, that&#x2019;s not unusual, I guess.&#x201d; </p><p>He chuckled at that, and she was shocked at the husky warmth of the sound. </p><p>&#x201c;It should be unusual. Alas, I find myself at the end of this particular job though, and I&#x2019;m lookin&#x2019; forward to the downtime.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;A job? I thought Breeds were taken care of by the government?&#x201d; She knew they were. The bastards didn&#x2019;t have to do anything. The only jobs they seemed to have were those of tracking down scientists and murdering them. </p><p>He grimaced at her comment as she felt his fingertips stroke down the back of her jacket, as though caressing her spine. &#x201c;Lass, no mon or government takes care of me. I&#x2019;ve a mind to pay my own way.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What sort of work do you do then?&#x201d; Keeping conversation going was imperative. Keeping her mind away from the fact that she was in a Breed&#x2019;s arms would be the only way to stay sane. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been aiding a friend in a small investigation the past year or so.&#x201d; He shrugged as though it didn&#x2019;t matter. &#x201c;Too little information and too many false leads have brought me home though. Finally.&#x201d; </p><p>He sounded tired, not as tired as she knew she was, but at least weary of whatever game he had been playing with her. </p><p>&#x201c;Your friend didn&#x2019;t have all the information you needed then?&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t have to pretend interest. </p><p>&#x201c;Too little information and too little cash,&#x201d; he chuckled. &#x201c;Perhaps when he can pay my fee, we&#x2019;ll be talkin&#x2019; again.&#x201d; </p><p>Too little information. Too little pay. Navarro might know what she looked like, but it seemed she had stayed far enough ahead of them that the other Breed hadn&#x2019;t been able to point her out to his friend. </p><p>She never took pictures. The driver&#x2019;s license she carried was under an assumed name, just as the credit cards she carried were. </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going back to Haven then?&#x201d; she asked, wishing he would hurry and go. Wishing he had left before he managed to run into her. </p><p>&#x201c;Only if ye make me, lass. I could spend the night in much more interesting pursuits than those to be found at Haven if you&#x2019;re willing.&#x201d; </p><p>Styx Mackenzie was a flirt, a true Breed man-whore, she had often thought. He wasn&#x2019;t as newsworthy as other Breeds, but he had a following of female groupies who congregated on the Internet, and who posted every sighting of him possible. Whose home he was seen entering, what time the next morning he left. His current lovers, past lovers and possible potential lovers. </p><p>He made no secret of his approval of their posts each time he joined them online, and despite his attempts to remain camera shy, he was caught often in both video as well as photo. </p><p>He was becoming the poster guy for the flirtatious, unthreatening Breed. Which never failed to shock her, because the potential for killing was there in his eyes. </p><p>Wasn&#x2019;t it? </p><p>&#x201c;No answer? Is that a stern and forbiddin&#x2019; no then?&#x201d; That smile flashed, and those blue eyes filled with warmth and a latent lust that had her thighs tensing. </p><p>God, she was wet! </p><p>She felt the sharp inhalation of surprise that she couldn&#x2019;t hide. She was aroused. That easily, that quickly. As though her body was suddenly refusing to cooperate with her mind in hating every Breed she met. </p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t hate and want at the same time, could she? </p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like Breeds,&#x201d; she whispered. </p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t lie to him. She wanted to. She wanted to play the game, she wanted to tease and lure him until she escaped his clutches as easily as she had other Breeds. </p><p>He almost paused. A frown touched his brow, touched those incredible blue eyes. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a mon, lass, not just a Breed. It&#x2019;s a wee like sayin&#x2019; ye dislike all Chineses, ye dislike all Italians or all people in general, wouldn&#x2019;t ye think?&#x201d; </p><p>His voice was gentle, almost understanding. </p><p>His hand stroked up her back, his fingers pressed against her spine, and she found herself wishing she was stupid enough to sink into him. </p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps I just dislike all Breeds,&#x201d; she stated. And she was lying, because she knew a part of her hated all Breeds. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell ye what.&#x201d; That smile was back. &#x201c;Try me ...</p></p><h2>Aiding Talmud Study</h2><p>Contains key Aramaic words, phrases, and abbreviations, with English translation.

The Omega Workshops, started in London in 1913 by Roger Fry, were a venture without precedent, aiming to produce decorative art from a background - not of crafts - but of painting. They boasted such talents as Vanessa Bell, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Duncan Grant and Wyndham Lewis. The Omega closed in 1919, but Bloomsbury decorative work did not cease. Vanessa Bell remained the central figure; settled into life at Charleston in Sussex, she and Duncan Grant continued to design objects and schemes, and her children later made their own contributions, Quentin as potter and Angelica as painter. Isabelle Anscombe&#39;s text, drawing on unpublished sources, catches the flavour of the time and its characters, from bohemians to haut monde. Howard Grey was allowed to print and reproduce early snapshot negatives, and his own photographs, begun before Duncan Grant&#39;s death, include unique records of Charleston still inhabited by one of its creators.</p><p></p><h2>Superstring Theory: Volume 1, Introduction (Cambridge Monographs on Mathematical Physics)</h2><p>In recent years, superstring theory has emerged as a promising approach to reconciling general relativity with quantum mechanics and unifying the fundamental interactions.

These powerful, haunting paintings are widely recognized and revered, especially his iconic work The Scream (1893). Yet few admirers of Munch&#39;s early works realize that the artist lived well into the twentieth century and was enormously productive almost to the time of his death. This compelling book, focusing on more than sixty of Munch&#39;s later paintings, reveals the surprising, vibrant work of a fascinating man who never ceased to grow as an artist. Following decades of restless wandering among the capitals of Europe, Munch suffered a breakdown in Copenhagen in 1908 and retreated to his native Norway. In 1916 he purchased an estate near present-day Oslo where he lived and worked, mostly in his outdoor studio, for the next twenty years. Although Munch never abandoned a deeply introspective approach to image-making, in his later works he expressed a new attachment to the visible world, adopting a fresh range of subjects and a looser, brighter painting style. The pictures of this period-full of vivid color, evocative atmospheres, and visual drama-are a revelation, casting new light on one of the most complex artists of the modern era. :</p><p>This book accompanies the first major exhibition of Edvard Munch&#39;s paintings in the United States since 1978 and the first ever to focus on his late works. The exhibition opens in February 2002 at the High Museum of Art, Atlanta.

In an area often rent by competing methodologies, editors David A. Lake and Robert Powell take the best of accepted and contested knowledge among many theories. With the contributors to this volume, they offer a unifying perspective, which begins with a simple insight: students of international relations want to explain the choices actors make--whether these actors be states, parties, ethnic groups, companies, leaders, or individuals.</p><br><p> This synthesis offers three new benefits: first, the strategic interaction of actors is the unit of analysis, rather than particular states or policies; second, these interactions are now usefully organized into analytic schemes, on which conceptual experiments may be based; and third, a set of methodological "bets" is then made about the most productive ways to analyze the interactions. Together, these elements allow the pragmatic application of theories that may apply to a myriad of particular cases, such as individuals protesting environmental degradation, governments seeking to control nuclear weapons, or the United Nations attempting to mobilize member states for international peacekeeping. Besides the editors, the six contributors to this book, all distinguished scholars of international relations, are Jeffry A. Frieden, James D. Morrow, Ronald Rogowski, Peter Gourevitch, Miles Kahler, and Arthur A. Stein. Their work is an invaluable introduction for scholars and students of international relations, economists, and government decision-makers.</p></p><p><p>"This is one of the best edited volumes in international relations I have seen.

His books include While Gods Are Falling, winner of the BP Independence Award, the Caribbean classic The Dragon Can&#39;t Dance, and Salt, which won the 1997 Commonwealth Writers Prize.Caribbean writer Lovelace, whose Salt won the 1997 Commonwealth Writer's Prize, returns with a story (first published in England in 1979) that offers a defining and luminously sensitive portrait of postcolonial island life. The island in question is recently independent Trinidad, but it could be any Caribbean island settled by European planters, African slaves, and indentured East Indians. Carnival time is at hand, and the inhabitants of the Hill, former slaves, who ``survive here, holding their poverty as a possession,'' are getting ready for this Mardi Graslike celebration: Steel bands are practicing, calypso singers and writers--like the diffident Philo--are creating new songs, and Aldrick Prospect, as usual, is working on his dragon costume. Aldrick, who, like most of the men, is unemployed, comes alive at Carnival, where it's his mission to do the Dragon dance, a dance that expresses all the people's frustrations and memories of their warrior past, and affirms their power--power that, if provoked, could burn down the city. But this year Aldrick, who's spurned the advances of young Sylvia, finds himself brooding. Change is in the air--those steel bands are acquiring commercial sponsors, the old fighting spirit of the people is changing to passive acceptance, and Aldrick's friends are drifting away and making new lives. After Carnival, Aldrick, feeling like ``the last symbol of rebellion,'' continues to brood, especially when he sees Sylvia take up with Guy, a notorious womanizer. He befriends Fisheye, an angry radical, and joins a futile rebellion against the government. Aldrick is jailed but, unlike the others, doesn't accept defeat, and once released--still depressed--he returns to the Hill. Finally, a quiet epiphany and a promise of Sylvia's affection present him with hope and reason enough to give up the impotent protest of the Dragon's dance. A poignant, beautifully crafted tale about a man and his country on the cusp of change. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He exhibited trick shots with pistols, swords and bowling. He danced the hornpipe and deceived audiences with his skill in magic. He was a remarkable calligrapher specializing in micrography&#x2015;handsome, precise letters almost impossible to view with the naked eye&#x2015;and he drew portraits, coats of arms, landscapes and family trees, many commissioned by royalty. Amazingly, Buchinger was just 29 inches tall, and born without legs or arms. He lived to the ripe old age of 65, survived three wives, wed a fourth and fathered 14 children. Accompanying the Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition <i>Wordplay: Matthias Buchinger&#x2019;s Inventive Drawings from the Collection of Ricky Jay</i>, the book is a cabinet containing a single, multifaceted wonder, refracted through author Ricky Jay&#x2019;s scholarship and storytelling. Alongside an unprecedented and sumptuously reproduced selection of Buchinger&#x2019;s marvelous drawings and etchings, Jay delves into the history and mythology of the "Little Man," while also chronicling his encounters with the many fascinating characters whom he meets in his passionate search for Buchinger. <br><b>Ricky Jay</b> is considered one of the world&#x2019;s great sleight-of-hand artists. His career is further distinguished by his accomplishments as author, actor and historian of "unusual entertainments." He has appeared in films directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, Gus Van Sant and David Mamet.

After deep reflection on her tradition, Edman is struck by the realization that her queer identity has taught her more about how to be a good Christian than the church.<br><br>In <i>Queer Virtue</i>, Edman posits that Christianity, at its scriptural core, incessantly challenges its adherents to rupture false binaries, to &#x201c;queer&#x201d; lines that pit people against one another. Thus, Edman asserts that Christianity, far from being hostile to queer people, is itself inherently queer. Arguing from the heart of scripture, she reveals how queering Christianity&#x2014;that is, disrupting simplistic ways of thinking about self and other&#x2014;can illuminate contemporary Christian faith. Pushing well past the notion that &#x201c;Christian love = tolerance,&#x201d; Edman offers a bold alternative: the recognition that queer people can help Christians better understand their fundamental calling and the creation of sacred space where LGBTQ Christians are seen as gifts to the church.<br><br>By bringing queer ethics and Christian theology into conversation, Edman also shows how the realities of queer life demand a lived response of high moral caliber&#x2014;one that resonates with the ethical path laid down by Christianity. Lively and impassioned, Edman proposes that queer experience be celebrated as inherently valuable, ethically virtuous, and illuminating the sacred.<br><br>A rich and nuanced exploration, <i>Queer Virtue</i> mines the depths of Christianity&#x2019;s history, mission, and core theological premises to call all Christians to a more authentic and robust understanding of their faith.</p><p><b>The Reverend Elizabeth M. Edman</b> is an Episcopal priest and a political strategist who has been expanding people&#x2019;s understanding of faith and sexuality for over twenty-five years. She has worked on the most pressing contemporary issues at the intersection of religion and sexuality, serving as an inner-city hospital chaplain to people with HIV/AIDS from 1989 to 1995 and helping to craft political and communications strategies for marriage-equality efforts. She lives in New York City.&#x201c;[Edman&#x2019;s] tone and personal examples are compelling. By turning the conversation around to show what queerness can tell readers about Christianity, this work provides a striking road map for larger, more productive conversations and community building.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly, Starred Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;An intellectual and provocative perspective challenging Christians and others to reconsider the confines of spiritual interconnection, harmony, and progressive inclusion in modern religion.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews, Starred Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;Edman&#x2019;s fellow progressive Christians may pay closest attention to her absorbing argument. Perhaps all Christians ought to.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br>&#x201c;A passionate argument...blend of personal, political, and theological reflection on the experience of LGBTQ people...reach LGBTQ readers who find themselves moved by Edman&#x2019;s case for the spiritual resonance of queer identities and values...This work will appeal to those with an interest in the relationship between queerness and faith, and the thematic chapters are easily adaptable for group study.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i>, Starred Review<br><br>&#x201c;Elizabeth Edman&#x2019;s <i>Queer Virtue</i> is a powerful work of theological and autobiographical reflection that illuminates the deep connections between queerness and Christianity. This book will be a valuable guide for anyone who navigates the liminal spaces between these distinct yet mutually reinforcing worlds.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Reverend Patrick S. Cheng, author of <i>Radical Love: An Introduction to Queer Theology</i><br><br>&#x201c;The once marginalized discipline of gay studies is now decidedly back in the curriculum and in the intellectual arena. This book is a sterling example of the best of it, and on a subject&#x2014;ethics and morality&#x2014;that is an emerging area of interest in all fields. It will be a little classic, and will be read and argued about for a long time to come.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Harvey Cox, author of <i>The Future of Faith</i> and <i>How to Read the Bible</i><br><br>&#x201c;Edman writes with the tender hand, approachable intelligence, and wise humility of that super-smart, big-hearted priest you always want yet rarely find. Her warm and personal words engage Judeo-Christian tradition, as well as pop culture. She returns us to the radical roots of our faith, while showing us how relevant its teachings still are. She calls us to community&#x2014;a powerful message for queer people who have been alienated from the church. She takes words we think we know&#x2014;&#x2018;scandal,&#x2019; &#x2018;pride,&#x2019; &#x2018;queerness&#x2019;&#x2014;and encourages us to consider them in a new light. And at a time when narratives about Christianity are often hyperindividualistic and oversimplified, she reminds us of a vibrant gospel that&#x2019;s richly relational, comfortingly complex, and inherently hopeful. A vital read.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Jeff Chu, author of <i>Does Jesus Really Love Me?: A Gay Christian&#x2019;s Pilgrimage in Search of God in America</i><br><br>&#x201c;Hot Damn! Rev. Edman&#x2019;s book is a breath of fresh, queer, air that scatters away a dusty history of half-assed sexual apologetics with a invigorating proclamation: that sex is good and queerness is Godly. Writing from a place of deep love of queer communities, Edman reveals that, just as in so many biblical stories, the ones who &#x2018;get&#x2019; the Gospel are the ones who have been disregarded, disparaged or abandoned by the so-called righteous. In pushing queer folks to the sidelines, the Church has not only damaged God&#x2019;s children and failed to live in love, but further, missed a central lesson about what it means to follow Jesus. Edman shares her discoveries of the virtue at the heart of queer communities with vivacious smarts and a wicked sense of humor that compels her readers to ditch the false binaries that keep us fettered and instead fully embrace our gloriously multifaceted God-given identities. If you&#x2019;ve wondered if you can be fully queer and fully Christian, the answer is a resounding &#x2018;yes,&#x2019; and Edman will show you the way.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Emily Scott, pastor, St. Lydia&#x2019;s Dinner Church</p><h2>Theology as a Way of Life: On Teaching and Learning the Christian Faith</h2><p>What difference does Jesus Christ make for the way we teach the Christian faith? &nbsp;If he is truly God and truly human, if he reveals God to us and us to ourselves, how might that shape our approach to teaching Christianity? Drawing on the work of S�ren Kierkegaard, Karl Barth, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Adam Neder offers a clear and creative theological and spiritual reflection on the art of teaching the Christian faith. This engaging book provides a wealth of fresh theological insights and practical suggestions for anyone involved in teaching and learning Christianity.</p><p><b>"Simply superb"<br><br></b>"This is the book I wish I could have read when I started teaching theology over thirty years ago. Ironically, much literature on theological pedagogy these days is woefully bereft of theology. Every page of this book takes its ultimate cue, materially and formally, from the Christ-shaped gospel itself--in all its disturbing and heart-wrenching glory. At the same time, the text is jargon-free, utterly honest, and obviously born out of years of classroom experience. It is simply superb."<br>--<b>Jeremy Begbie</b>, Duke Divinity School<br><br>"Neder has written a beautiful book. It is also a profound book, one which will reward multiple readings. What comes to expression here is the 'impossible possibility' of teaching theology, and the kind of theological existence the teacher must herself reflect if she wants her students to know that this human impossibility is nonetheless, by God's grace, possible. This is a book that stands in favorable comparison with Barth's <i>Evangelical Theology</i>. Surely, a book for our times--and for all times."<br>--<b>Bruce McCormack</b>, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>"Neder's book has as its central claim that you cannot know Jesus from a safe distance. Yet as he makes clear, theologians are tempted to make it safe to follow and think with Jesus. Neder does not make that mistake, which is why this is such a challenging and constructive book."<br>--<b>Stanley Hauerwas</b>, Duke Divinity School<br><br>"This honest, realistic, yet deeply encouraging handbook for Christian theological educators is brimming with wise practical principles. Those who love to teach and learn about God--whether in the academy, the church, or the home--will themselves be taught and inspired by a vision of the task of Christian theology and the nature of the Christian life grounded in the glorious reality of God's work for us in Jesus Christ."<br>--<b>Han-luen Kantzer Komline</b>, Western Theological Seminary<br><br>"An incisive, wise, and wonderful book on teaching theology. I wish it had been around when I began teaching. It should be required reading."<br>--<b>Kimlyn&nbsp;J. Bender</b>, Truett Theological Seminary, Baylor University<br><br>"This is a beautiful page-turner of a book, a must-read for all who engage in teaching the Christian faith. Whether you are in the church or the classroom, just embarking upon your calling or have been teaching for decades, Neder's powerful, grace-bathed theological reflections on teaching the Christian faith will impact why and how you do what you do."<br>--<b>Kristen Deede Johnson</b>, Western Theological Seminary<br><b><br></b>"Here is a volume of warmth and wisdom on teaching theology. Drawing heavily on the insight of figures like Barth, Bonhoeffer, and Kierkegaard, Neder points us to lived theology that is personal and vibrant, honest and faithful. Encouragements--and warnings--bounce off the pages as Neder provides tried and tested counsel on good teaching and healthy classroom practices, all done with and before the triune God: we have much to learn from him!"<br>--<b>Kelly&nbsp;M. Kapic</b>, Covenant College<br><b><br></b>"The person you meet in this book is a deeply serious, self-critical Christian gentleman, who is passionately discipled to the person and work of Jesus Christ and who yearns for the discipline of theology to be taught compassionately, intelligently, and engagingly. If Neder were to write a comprehensive account of Christian theology, I would be as eager to read it as I once was to read Karl Barth's <i>Church Dogmatics.</i>"<br>--<b>Frederick Dale Bruner</b>, Union Theological Seminary, Philippines, and Whitworth University (emeritus)<br><br>"What does it mean to be 'in Christ'? Neder wonders what it means to <i>teach</i> 'in Christ.' For those of us in academia or pastoring a congregation, this comes as both a challenge and a gift. Neder joins Barth's ever-present call to 'theological existence' in which not just the content but the praxis of our teaching is changed by the person of Christ. Prayer, personal integration, humility, and even publishing are discussed in this light (with the help of World Cup and Radiohead analogies). As Neder says, 'Teaching Christianity is an act of love.' So is this book."<br>--<b>Julie Canlis</b>, Whitworth University<b>Adam Neder </b>(PhD, Princeton Theological Seminary) is Bruner-Welch Professor of Theology at Whitworth University in Spokane, Washington, and the author of <i>Participation in Christ: An Entry into Karl Barth's </i>Church Dogmatics.

But Buddhism has also inspired and accumulated some of the greatest philosophical texts of any religion. Two works lie at the center of Zen: The Heart Sutra, which monks recite all over the world, and The Diamond Sutra, which teaches the "perfection of wisdom" and cuts through all obstacles on the path of practice. It is perhaps the most studied of all the sutras, and by one count more than twenty thousand commentaries are noted.<br>Red Pine, as he begins his preface, explains: "The Diamond may look like a book, but it's really the body of the Buddha. It's also your body, my body, all possible bodies. But it's a body with nothing inside and nothing outside. It doesn't exist in space or time. Nor it is a construct of the mind. It's no mind. And yet because it's no mind, it has room for compassion. This book is the offering of no mind, born of compassion for all suffering beings. Of all the sutras that teach this teaching, this is the diamond. It cuts through all delusions, illuminates what is real, and cannot be destroyed. It is the path on which all buddhas stand and walk. And to read it is to stand and walk with buddhas."<br>Red Pine, the translator and Buddhist scholar, has worked with this text for many years. He has consulted dozens of commentaries, in Chinese and in Sanskrit, to offer this brilliant new translation together with extensive commentary intended to present this sacred text in a new light.

Too often speakers are shouted down, professors are threatened, and classes are disrupted. In <i>Speak Freely</i>, Keith Whittington argues that universities must protect and encourage free speech because vigorous free speech is the lifeblood of the university. Without free speech, a university cannot fulfill its most basic, fundamental, and essential purposes, including fostering freedom of thought, ideological diversity, and tolerance.</p><br><p>Examining such hot-button issues as trigger warnings, safe spaces, hate speech, disruptive protests, speaker disinvitations, the use of social media by faculty, and academic politics, <i>Speak Freely</i> describes the dangers of empowering campus censors to limit speech and enforce orthodoxy. It explains why free speech and civil discourse are at the heart of the university&#x2019;s mission of creating and nurturing an open and diverse community dedicated to learning. It shows why universities must make space for voices from both the left and right. And it points out how better understanding why the university lives or dies by free speech can help guide everyone&#x2015;including students, faculty, administrators, and alumni&#x2015;when faced with difficult challenges such as unpopular, hateful, or dangerous speech.</p><br><p>Timely and vitally important, <i>Speak Freely</i> demonstrates why universities can succeed only by fostering more free speech, more free thought&#x2015;and a greater tolerance for both.</p></p><p><p>"No other book so accessibly presents the fundamental principles of the free speech tradition and applies them to contemporary campus controversies--ranging from the heckling or disinviting of campus speakers to attempts to censure faculty for social media postings. A compelling defense of the university as an enclave of reason, <i>Speak Freely</i> is fresh, illuminating, galvanizing, and persuasive."<b>--Jeffrey Rosen, National Constitution Center and George Washington University Law School</b></p><p>"If John Stuart Mill were around today, this is the book he might write about the free speech crisis on college campuses. Keith Whittington drills deep beneath the law and the excesses of political correctness to explain why universities&#x2019; foremost mission is to make and spread knowledge, even at the cost of discomfort, offense, or pain. At a time when many universities have lost their way, <i>Speak Freely</i> exemplifies the clarity, civility, and compassion that they--and we--so badly need."<b>--Jonathan Rauch, author of <i>Kindly Inquisitors: The New Attacks on Free Thought</i></b></p><p>"Freedom of speech is crucial to the university and democracy. Keith Whittington provides a deep exploration of the reasons why--and carefully examines contemporary challenges on college campuses."<b>--David Boaz, executive vice president of the Cato Institute and author of <i>The Libertarian Mind</i></b></p><p>"An astute, crucial reminder that free speech and a diversity of perspectives are necessary prerequisites for a vibrant intellectual life. Whittington&#x2019;s persuasive case for both comes at a critical time for all members of the university community, as well as our larger society. <i>Speak Freely</i> is essential reading for everyone who is concerned about higher education and intellectual freedom."<b>--Nadine Strossen, former president of the American Civil Liberties Union and author of <i>HATE: Why We Should Resist It with Free Speech, Not Censorship</i></b></p><p>"<i>Speak Freely</i> is a thoughtful and compelling account of how colleges and universities came to embrace the value of free expression as central to their mission, why they should remain faithful to that value in the face of current controversies, and how they should best approach and address these issues.

More than a few gruesome images are included, though the warm tones of the printing and the antique dress have an anesthetizing effect on the viewer. There are also a good number of images depicting obsolete mid-19th-century practices. The chronological arrangement does impart a sense of progress as we move from images of horrible deformity through pictures of amputation during the Civil War to photos of reparative surgery following World War I.

Birds and insects are nature&#x2019;s premier architects, using a dizzying array of talents to build functional homes in which to live, reproduce, and care for their young. Recycling sticks, branches, grass, and mud to construct their shelters, they are undoubtedly the originators of &#x201c;green architecture.&#x201d;<br>A visual celebration of these natural feats of engineering and ingenuity, <i>Architecture by Birds and Insects</i> allows readers a peek inside a wide range of nests, offering a rare opportunity to get a sense of the materials and methods used to build them. Here, we see the kinds of places where nests are built&#x2014;for instance, the house wren has been known to occupy cow skulls, flower pots, tin cans, and the pockets of hanging laundry, while the uglynest caterpillar prefers rose bushes and cherry trees. Inspired by the vast nest collection at the Field Museum, which features specimens gathered throughout North and South America, Peggy Macnamara&#x2019;s paintings are enhanced by text written by museum curators. This narrative provides a foundation in natural history for each painting, as well as fascinating anecdotes about the nests and their builders.<br>Like so many natural treasures, nests are easy to ignore. But Macnamara&#x2019;s gorgeous paintings will undoubtedly change that. <i>Architecture by Birds and Insects </i>at last gives the tiniest engineers their rightful moment in the spotlight, and in so doing increases awareness and encourages the protection of birds, insects, and their habitats. Readers will never look at a Frank Gehry design, or a treetop nest, the same way again.</p><p><b>Peggy Macnamara</b> is adjunct associate professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago; artist-in-residence and associate of the zoology program at the Field Museum; instructor at the Field Museum, Chicago Public Libraries Nature Connection, and Art Institute family programs; and author of <i>Illinois Insects and Spiders, </i>also published by the University of Chicago Press.&#34;In these pages, the predators and parasites become more than a necessary part of our ecosystem - they are living objects of beauty.&#34; - Elizabeth Taylor, Chicago Tribune &#34;A delightful and surprising book, representing the best kind of synergy of art and science.

But seeking common civic ground in public schools has never been easy in a society where schoolchildren followed different religions, adhered to different cultural traditions, spoke many languages, and were identified as members of different "races."</p><p>In this wise and enlightening book, filled with vivid characters and memorable incidents that make history but don't always make history books, David Tyack describes how each American generation grappled with the knotty task of creating political unity and social diversity.</p><p><i>Seeking Common Ground</i> illuminates puzzles about democracy in education and chronic conflicts that continue to make news. Americans mistrusted government, yet they entrusted the civic education of their children to public schools. American history textbooks were notoriously dull, but they were also highly controversial. Although the people liked local control of schools, educational experts called it "democracy gone to seed" and campaigned to "take the schools out of politics." Reformers argued about whether it was more democratic to teach all students the same subjects or to tailor curriculum to individuals. And what was the best way to "Americanize" immigrants, asked educators: by forced-fed assimilation or by honoring their ethnic heritages?</p><p>With a broad perspective and an eye for telling detail, Tyack lets us see that debates about the civic purposes of schools are an essential part of a democratic culture, and integral to its future.</p></p><p>David B. Tyack (1930&#x2013;2016) was Vida Jacks Professor of Education, Emeritus, and Professor of History, Emeritus, at Stanford University.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/TYASEE_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>Watches Tell More Than Time: Product Design, Information, and the Quest for Elegance</h2><p><p><b>From Audis to iMacs, Beetles to palm-tops, the design secrets behind some of the biggest business success stories of all times</b></p> <p><i>"Del Coates has written a definitive playbook for product managers on how to cultivate winning design leadership strategies."</i>��Betty Baugh, President of the Industrial Designers Society of America</p> <p>In <i>Watches Tell More Than Time</i>, awardwinning designer and mentor Del Coates explains the importance of product design for businesspeople and other nondesigners. From an explanation of the physiology of our responses to product design, to secrets of achieving harmony and elegance, to the impact of computer-assisted modeling on modern design, Coates covers the topic from every angle, using real-life product design case studies to illustrate his points. A lively and accessible exploration of the fascinating world of product design, written by an internationally acknowledged master, <i>Watches Tell More Than Time </i>will appeal to managers and executives, marketing professionals, and design junkies interested in the subject.</p></p><p><p>The design of every product conveys certain information, and modern consumers are experts in reading the language of product design. Most of us can discern the different messages conveyed by say, a Rolex versus a Swatch, a Porsche versus a Hummer, a Kenneth Cole versus a Bally, or an iMac versus a Compaq. But whether we're talking watches, cars, shoes, personal computers or any other mass-produced item, how many of us can say with any real conviction what differentiates a good design from a bad one, or exactly how the good design manages to tell its story so clearly and so well to so many people?</p> <p> Design experts, psychologists, marketing theorists, and even French philosophers have wrestled with these questions for nearly a century. But few have provided more comprehensive or persuasive answers to these questions international industrial design authority Del Coates has in this fascinating and accessible book. <i>Watches Tell More Than Time </i>is a much needed resource for shaping corporate design strategies, evaluating product designs at any stage of development or marketing��and optimizing them.</p> <p> Drawing upon findings in an array of disciplines, including aesthetics, psychology, information theory, physiology, anthropology, as well as his own vast experience as an award-winning industrial designer, Coates peels back the layers of some of the greatest product designs, past and present, to reveal the secrets behind their success. From the neurophysiology of human perception and how it shapes our responses to design elements, to the secrets of achieving harmony and elegance, he attacks the subject from every conceivable angle in order to flush out the basic laws of good design. And perhaps more fully and eloquently than any author before him, he explains exactly why, while <i>zeitgeists</i> come and <i>zeitgeists</i> go, and today's Space Age sensation is tomorrow's white elephant, the principles of good design are forever.</p> <p> <i>Watches Tell More than Time</i> is essential reading for managers, entrepreneurs, marketing and advertising professionals and virtually anyone in business who understands that, in today's volatile global marketplace, more than ever before, superior design is the key to success. At the same time, this book offers design professionals and "design junkies" a unique opportunity to learn the secrets of successful product design from an acknowledged master.</p> <p><i>From Audis to iMacs, Beetles to palm-tops, the design secrets behind some of the biggest business success stories of all times</i></p> <p>In this fascinating and informative book, award-winning designer and international design mentor, Del Coates, explains why design is so important to the success of a product. And, with the help of examples of many of the best product designs of all times, he takes design professionals and non-designers alike on a lively excursion into the world of product design to reveal the subtle interplay of psychological, physiological, and aesthetic forces informing both the design of man-made products and our responses to them.</p><p><b>Del Coates</b> is a professor of design in the world famous San Jose State University design department. He has worked as an industrial designer, on corporate staffs, and as a consultant on a broad range of product, including consumer products, furniture (as a member of the renowned Herman Miller design team), automobiles (he coined the product strategy and the name for Nissan Maxima), and computers (applying his methods, he contributed to the design of only the second computer to be added to the MOMA's permanent collection). Del lectures often and widely around the world, most recently this summer as an invited guest for DaimlerChrysler AG's research and development group, at the University of Sunderland in England, and at the ISATA Conference on Automotive Technology in Vienna. He teaches each summer at the University of Michigan's Human Factors Engineering Conference and chairs product design sessions at the Silicon Valley Ergonomics Institute's meetings. He writes a regular column for IDSA journal and has published a number of seminal articles in a variety of journals and professional publications. In addition to his teaching and speaking, Del consults to many of the world's top companies including Unisys, Daewoo, Mooney Aircraft, Nissan, General Motors, Peterbilt, Hewlett Packard, Rockwell International, Tandy, Black &amp; Decker, Kodak, General Electric, NCR, Owens-Corning, Pitney Bowes, and Xerox.</p></p><h2>Southern Horrors: Women and the Politics of Rape and Lynching</h2><p><p>Between 1880 and 1930, close to 200 women were murdered by lynch mobs in the American South. Many more were tarred and feathered, burned, whipped, or raped. In this brutal world of white supremacist politics and patriarchy, a world violently divided by race, gender, and class, black and white women defended themselves and challenged the male power brokers. Crystal Feimster breaks new ground in her story of the racial politics of the postbellum South by focusing on the volatile issue of sexual violence.</p><p>Pairing the lives of two Southern women&#x2015;Ida B. Wells, who fearlessly branded lynching a white tool of political terror against southern blacks, and Rebecca Latimer Felton, who urged white men to prove their manhood by lynching black men accused of raping white women&#x2015;Feimster makes visible the ways in which black and white women sought protection and political power in the New South. While Wells was black and Felton was white, both were journalists, temperance women, suffragists, and anti-rape activists. By placing their concerns at the center of southern politics, Feimster illuminates a critical and novel aspect of southern racial and sexual dynamics. Despite being on opposite sides of the lynching question, both Wells and Felton sought protection from sexual violence and political empowerment for women.</p><p><i>Southern Horrors</i> provides a startling view into the Jim Crow South where the precarious and subordinate position of women linked black and white anti-rape activists together in fragile political alliances. It is a story that reveals how the complex drama of political power, race, and sex played out in the lives of Southern women.</p></p><p>Crystal N. Feimster is Associate Professor of African American Studies, American Studies, and History at Yale University.&#x201c;Feimster's compelling, and profoundly unsettling, history of rape and lynching illuminates the gendered racial politics of sexual violence in the aftermath of Emancipation.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Darlene Clark Hine, Northwestern University</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Southern Horrors</i>, a chilling tale that has been largely suppressed until now, exposes lynching as a gendered phenomenon in which southern women played a central role as actors and as victims. This is a breakthrough analysis of the role that lynching served in southern political culture.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore, author of <i>Defying Dixie: The Radical Roots of Civil Rights, 1919&#x2013;1950</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Feimster traces the lives of two political incendiaries, Ida B. Wells and Rebecca Felton, who illuminate the landscape of American race and gender politics. Brilliantly analytical, strikingly well-narrated, this monumental book masters theme and story to reveal heretofore hidden histories of the women who both played and transformed the politics of rape and lynching in the New South.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Timothy B. Tyson, author of <i>Blood Done Sign My Name: A True Story</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Thoughtful and engaging, Crystal Feimster's <i>Southern Horrors</i> forces us to rethink women's history and the history of the American South.

Litwack, author of <i>Trouble in Mind: Black Southerners in the Age of Jim Crow</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Fascinating...Feimster's account challenges us to think again about race and sexual politics...[A] rich and detailed account...The work of Rebecca Felton and Ida Wells engaged with the implications of a form (although not a unique one) of sexual politics, and Feimster's account should be rightly acclaimed as testament to these projects.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mary Evans</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Historian Crystal N. Feimster provides an opportunity to better understand the lack of sympathy between black and white suffragists and how lynching spurred both to the political activism that eventually won women the vote...This account leaves us with a sense of what made the fights for racial equality and women's suffrage so complicated and contentious. We're left, too, with an appreciation of the gumption both Wells and Felton showed entering a political fray resistant to their participation and unable to conceive of changes that seem so obviously necessary in hindsight.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Margaret Wheeler Johnson</b><b>, </b><b><i>Double X</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;An interesting, though somewhat disheartening, tale of the times, this book is destined for a special place in the classrooms and libraries of those concerned with sexual and racial politics.

Original essays by leading media scholars and historians of medicine demonstrate that Americans throughout the twentieth century have learned about health, disease, medicine, and the human body from movies. Heroic doctors and patients fighting dread diseases have thrilled and moved audiences everywhere; amid changing media formats, medicine&#39;s moving pictures continue to educate, entertain, and help us understand the body&#39;s journey through life. Perennially popular, health and medical media are also complex texts reflecting many interests and constituencies including, notably, the U.S. medical profession, which has often sought, if not always successfully, to influence content, circulation, and meaning. Medicine&#39;s Moving Pictures makes clear that health and medical media representations are &#34;more than illustrations,&#34; shows their power to shape health perceptions, practices, and policies, and identifies their social, cultural, and historical contexts.

Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>Bringing bodily functions out of the (water) closet into polite conversation...This guide sparks a radical rethinking of our relationship with our bodies and Nature, humorously (and seriously) spanning the gamut of everything you ever wanted to know about bodily functions and excreta. Each bodily function is discussed from a variety of viewpoints: scientific, anthropological, historical, mythological, sociological, and artistic. <p>Topics include: constipation (such as its relationship to cornflakes and graham crackers!); the history and evolution of toilet-paper; farting (spotlighting the famous Joseph Pujol, a turn-of-the-century Fartiste who was so famous internationally for his fart-singing and comedy routines that a street was named after him in Paris); urine (including little-known facts about urinalysis); as well as many other engrossing topics. </p><p>As our culture undergoes profound transformation concerning its relationship with Nature and Earth, how can we realign with nature globally if we can't deal with our own excreta taboos and bodily functions?</p>RE/SEARCH GUIDE TO BODILY FLUIDS #16 From Victorian times well into this century, American magazines carried advertisements extolling the advantages of "silent flush" toilets. The idea was that if you were playing bridge with friends at home and the urge to excrete came, you could excuse yourself with some polite lie about wanting to check on the canary, attend to the horrid task, and then return to the table without anyone knowing where you'd been. If you lacked a "silent flush" model, however, the sound of the toilet would jar the guests to the realization that the "go check the canary" story was a lie, and that you had just wanted to take a leak or pinch a loaf after all. That hideous sound of common plumbing would brand you a liar and remind everyone of their mortality, letting you know that no matter how ready your minds and souls are to live in an eternal abstract world of language, reason, truth, beauty, and card games, you're still trapped inside aging meat machines. <p>Broadcast television constantly shows us murders, rapes, and dozens of other crimes which rarely, if ever, touch most of us directly. Records, books, and magazines can be even more explicit. The scatological, however, which affects all of us at all ages, is taboo. A perfectly healthy area of our lives, immediately comprehensible to anyone, can never be shown on television and is all but ignored by media which otherwise stop at nothing. Why? </p><p>Meanwhile, artists and writers who do draw upon the scatological, such as Andres Serrano and James Joyce, become centers of controversy. They're dragged into courtrooms and hearings and forced to defend their work against people shocked and offended as only people who are trying to escape from something within themselves can be. And all over things every three-year-old knows about and has no aversion to. What's going on here? </p><p>Many cultures in many times have used human excreta as components of medicines and magic potions. But it is in our culture today that these materials have the greatest magical power. We rarely mention them, but when we do, the effect can be electric. They're some of the commonest substances around, and yet because of what the represent to us and remind us of, they repel, shock, and offend. They're a part of us, literally inside of us all, but our collective reaction against them and against people who view them differently has motivated us to wage war, commit genocide, and destroy the environment. That's a lot of magic power. Magic power we could do without. </p><p>Erich Fromm, Norman O. Brown, and other drawing on Freud, have suggested that our society denies bodily functions because collectively we have an anal personality. Long ago, we repressed bodily desires in exchange for objectivity, industry, punctuality, and thrift. We prospered as a result, subjugating and controlling other less repressed societies and nature itself (locally, at least) with our science and technology. In exchange, however, we lost our comfort with ourselves and with life as a whole. Reminders of our past, our origins, our biology, disturb us deeply, and we, as people and as nations, constantly fight against those who threaten our fragile self-images. </p><p>At the same time, our reluctance to accept our oneness with nature has also brought us to the brink of worldwide ecological disaster. Our denial of nature grows from deep religious and cultural roots, so unfortunately, as Al Gore asserts in Earth in the Balance (1992), only a radical rethinking of our relationship with nature can save the earth's ecology for future generations. </p><p>I believe that radical rethinking starts at home. How can we realign with nature globally if we can't even do it with our own bodies? </p><p>Part of being repelled by our excretions probably derives from innate, health-preserving instincts that guard us from infection. But as with any of our other instincts (such as those relating to reproduction), the area where these innate individual inclinations meet and interact with the rational and society-building parts of our natures, is a fascinating tide-pool spawning many convoluted rationalizations and involved codes of conduct relating to essentially irrational behaviors. That's what makes the subject such a kick. </p><p>I found a lot of information about bodily functions at the library, but little of it explained how people deal with the things in their daily lives. For this information, I conducted my own survey that asked people detailed questions about their personal hygiene habits. I got most of my "subjects" by standing out in the main plaza of the U.C. Berkeley campus with a bunch of questionnaires, pens, and dollar bills. Calling out to passers-by that they could earn a dollar by simply filling out a questionnaire quickly attracted willing people, although some of them declined to participate once I told them what the survey was about or after they leafed through the questionnaire. The survey participants, like people in general, seemed genuinely interested in their bodily functions, but because of old and destructive taboos, the subject is still seldom publicly discussed or written about. Other subjects participated through the Internet; I announced the survey on the newsgroups rec.humor and alt.tasteless and received responses from as far away as England. (Similarly, I researched the "Bodily Functions In the Cinema" chapter by posting to the newsgroup rec.arts.movies, and the "Urination with Genital Piercings" chapter by posting to rec.arts.bodyart.) The last chapter reprints the final version of the questionnaire and discusses more fully how I conducted the survey. </p><p>Three final comments: First, I deliberately de-emphasized bodily fluids from the reproductive systems, not because they aren't interesting-menstrual blood is the most significant of all, culturally-but because I think sexual functioning gets plenty of press already. Second, I didn't cover disease. Fear already obscures our perception of bodily fluids, and many in the media have reacted to AIDS by adding even more irrational fear. I wanted to present a sunnier view by emphasizing health. Finally, much of this book questions attitudes and actions perpetuated by the dominant Western religious traditions but I believe that it is possible for an individual to adhere to any one of them in a thoughtful, positive, and enriching way.</p></p><h2>Ignite Your Passion for God: A 6-Week, No-Homework Bible Study (40-Minute Bible Studies)</h2><p><b>What does it take to fuel a faith that burns bright, no matter what?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> At different times in our spiritual journey, we may discover that we&#x2019;ve somehow developed apathy toward the things of God.

Michael Javen Fortner shows in this eye-opening account that these punitive policies also enjoyed the support of many working-class and middle-class blacks, who were angry about decline and disorder in their communities. <i>Black Silent Majority </i>uncovers the role African Americans played in creating today&#x2019;s system of mass incarceration.</p><p>Current anti-drug policies are based on a set of controversial laws first adopted in New York in the early 1970s and championed by the state&#x2019;s Republican governor, Nelson Rockefeller. Fortner traces how many blacks in New York came to believe that the rehabilitation-focused liberal policies of the 1960s had failed. Faced with economic malaise and rising rates of addiction and crime, they blamed addicts and pushers. By 1973, the outcry from grassroots activists and civic leaders in Harlem calling for drastic measures presented Rockefeller with a welcome opportunity to crack down on crime and boost his political career. New York became the first state to mandate long prison sentences for selling or possessing narcotics.<i></i><br><i></i><br><i>Black Silent Majority</i> lays bare the tangled roots of a pernicious system. America&#x2019;s drug policies, while in part a manifestation of the conservative movement, are also a product of black America&#x2019;s confrontation with crime and chaos in its own neighborhoods.</p></p><p>Michael Javen Fortner is Assistant Professor and Academic Director of Urban Studies at the CUNY School of Professional Studies, Murphy Institute.&#x201c;Provocative... As Fortner&#x2019;s book makes clear, no political movement can afford to ignore the kind of cruel disorder that we euphemistically call common crime. A police force that kills black citizens is adding to America&#x2019;s history of racial violence; so is a police force that fails to keep them safe.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Kelefa Sanneh</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Yorker</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Seeks to reverse the conventional wisdom about not only the Rockefeller laws themselves, but also the broader history of the war on drugs... After <i>Black Silent Majority</i>, historians can no longer reduce the &#x2019;60s and &#x2019;70s politics of crime to the delusional fantasies of racists or to statistical artifacts of modern police record-keeping (although those factors surely played a role as well). Fortner marshals an array of poll data showing that black city dwellers were&#x2015;and not without reason&#x2015;far more fearful of violence in the late 1960s than white suburbanites were.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Sara Mayeux</b><b>, </b><b><i>Reason</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This provocative history alerts a rising generation of would-be reformers&#x2015;the young masses that have recently filled the streets of New York and other cities to protest after each new tragedy&#x2015;to how a well-intentioned proposal can lead to something unintended and disastrous, like mass incarceration. This lesson should resound, given the political clout the criminal-justice-reform movement continues to acquire.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jack Dickey</b><b>, </b><b><i>Time</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A fresh, bold, powerful book that shakes up a pressing contemporary debate. Fortner insists on listening to the black voices that supported the rise of our terrible incarceration policies. Through careful research, he describes a deeply conflicted community&#x2015;confronting crime, groping for respectability, challenging the white gaze, and reaching for social justice. <i>Black Silent Majority</i> is forcefully argued, beautifully written, and profoundly moving.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James A. Morone, author of <i>Hellfire Nation</i> and <i>The Devils We Know</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Meticulously researched, engagingly written, and rigorously argued, this important and long-overdue work will be essential reading for anyone concerned with the hidden complexities of African American life. Fortner illuminates the problems that the majority of working- and middle-class blacks face from criminal elements within their communities; the sometimes patronizing indifference of white and black liberals toward them, compounded by the manipulation of their concerns by conservatives; and the tragic, unintended consequences of a flawed drug and penal policy they were driven, out of despair and fury, to support.

As Ramsay tells his story, it begins to seem that from boyhood, he has exerted a perhaps mystical, perhaps pernicious, influence on those around him. His apparently innocent involvement in such innocuous events as the throwing of a snowball or the teaching of card tricks to a small boy in the end prove neither innocent nor innocuous.&nbsp;<i>Fifth Business</i>&nbsp;stands alone as a remarkable story told by a rational man who discovers that the marvelous is only another aspect of the real.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

When the book appeared in 1970, he had already published the three books of his <b>Salterton Trilogy</b>, which won him recognition in his native Canada as an incisive cultural critic and an endlessly entertaining novelist. He had struck a note near Mark Twain in his portrayal of small-town culture, satirizing the residents' pious absurdities without seeming cruel, dramatizing their dreams and good intentions without becoming sentimental. </p><p> With <b>Fifth Business</b>, he plumbed new artistic and spiritual depths. The opening scene, which he envisioned taking place at his boyhood home in Thamesville, Ontario, haunted Davies from the first time it appeared to him in about 1960 until he began to draft the novel ten years later: "It was simply a scene that kept occurring in my mind, which was of two boys on a village street on a winter night--I knew from the look of the atmosphere that it must be just around Christmas-time--and one boy threw a snowball at the other boy. Well, that was all there was to it, but it came so often and was so insistent that I had to ask myself, Why is that boy doing that and what is behind this and what is going on?" </p><p> Many elements of the novel that emerged from this vision were drawn from Davies's early childhood. Like Dunstable Ramsay's father, Davies's father was the one-man publisher of a village newspaper, and Davies grew up in the newspaper business. "In a newspaper family," he said, "you learn not only all the news that's fit to print, but all the news that is not fit to print, and you acquire an insight into human nature and the essence of a community which is very hard to acquire . . . in any other way." </p><p> Like his protagonist in <b>Fifth Business</b>, Davies was raised in the Presbyterian Church. Although he eventually rejected its particular doctrines, he retained a strongly religious temperament. His spiritual explorations ultimately found resonance in the works of Carl Gustav Jung. "Orthodox Christianity has always had for me the difficulty that it really won't come . . . to grips with the problem of evil," Davies said. "What looks good can be pushed to the point that it becomes evil, and . . . evil very frequently bears what can only be regarded as good fruit." Jung had portrayed God as a psychological reality that embraced polarities of good and evil, light and shadow; the devil is an inextricable part of him. One had to confront this shadow face-to-face in order to live a moral life. "The devil is the unexamined side of life," Davies said, "and the great evils spring from acting without knowledge of your subconscious intentions." </p><p> Davies was also drawn to Jung's deities because they had womanly as well as manly faces, faces that are reflected in his portrayal of Mary Dempster. Here were the feminine elements he found woefully lacking in Christianity, with its focus on God the Father and the Son. In Jung's landscape of the psyche, Davies found a theoretical grounding for the diverse representations of human quest and conflict he had come to appreciate. Beyond the Judeo-Christian literary tradition was a rich world of folk tales, myths, ghost stories, and legends that were sacred in their own way, striking deep spiritual chords in our unconscious. From this same sensibility sprang Davies's lifelong interest in saints, which he, like Ramsay, appreciated not as narrowly defined religious figures, but as archetypes of universal characters and tales. </p><p> The remarkable events that unfold in this "enchanted landscape" owe much to Davies's lifelong love of the theater. From boyhood he was drawn to the traveling circus, the magic show, and the movie palace. Over the course of his career he worked for the Old Vic Repertory Company in London, wrote a dozen plays, and was one of the founders of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. His passion for theater was so intense that his novels have sometimes been criticized for their theatricality: How does Ramsay just happen to meet Paul Dempster repeatedly in his travels, and how does Surgeoner "randomly" pick Ramsay from the crowd at Colborne College? But such theatrical events--call them coincidence or fate--lie at the heart of Davies's worldview. "I'm not in any way a devotee of realism," said Davies, "and the theatre is never realistic, even when it's pretending to be intensely so." The meaningful stories in our lives are dramatic rather than naturalistic, remarkable rather than random. </p><p> This appreciation of the theater of the inner life could come only with age. Davies was in his fifties when he explored these demons of youth in <b>Fifth Business</b>, and the result is a captivating narrative stance. While working on the manuscript, he wrote, "It is autobiographical, but not as young men would do it; it will be rather as Dickens wrote <b>David Copperfield</b>--a fictional reworking of some things experienced and much rearranged--a spiritual autobiography in fact, and not a sweating account of the first time I backed a girl into a corner." Davies's protagonist frequently distances himself from immediate events, adding the tincture of age and humor to vividly recalled experience. </p><p>The unforgettable tone that arises from this perspective has been characterized as a hybrid of satire and romance. Davies somehow manages to marry these seemingly incompatible viewpoints, delighting in his own former naivet� and the follies of his youth while maintaining a fundamental earnestness about Ramsay's aspirations. It is the voice of a man at mid-life who has taken unusual paths, who is fascinated by the possibilities that lie before him, and who has lost neither his youthful seriousness nor his sense of humor. </p><p> Despite his established reputation in Canada, Davies was little known to U.S. readers and reviewers when <b>Fifth Business</b> was published in 1970. The American reception was exuberant, propelling the novel to bestseller lists in both the U.S. and Canada. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt described it in the <b>New York Times</b> as "a marvelously enigmatic novel . . . elegantly written and driven by irresistible narrative. One thinks of <b>The Magic Mountain</b> and <b>The French Lieutenant's Woman</b>, although Mr. Davies hardly needs Thomas Mann and John Fowles to prop him up." </p><p> Other reviewers praised the remarkable range of erudition he conveys in his works. Saints and card tricks, brandy and psychology, linguistics and bearded ladies are all objects of his insatiable curiosity. Davies is modest about the range of his learning, pointing out that some academics thought Shakespeare must have been a sailor because of the convincing seaman's slang in <b>The Tempest</b>: "It's all hooey. Shakespeare had a few telling details which he injected into his plays that made them seem realistic, and I have the same in my novels." A veteran once asked Davies where he had served in France during the Great War, for only a soldier could have captured the mud and panic of the trenches so vividly. Davies had to reply that he was in the cradle at the time. Similarly, his fictional prescription for bringing an ailing cello back to its true voice with a poultice of horse manure was pure fancy. Even the definition of "<b>Fifth Business</b>" that opens the book&#x2014;cited from a dull, untranslated account of Danish theater and first taken as yet another example of Davies's eccentric knowledge&#x2014;was revealed to be entirely fictional when the Norwegian edition of the book was published (although the notion it conveys of "<b>Fifth Business</b>" in the theater is quite accurate). </p><p> The key is to be convincing, true to the spirit rather than to mere facts. As Davies described the art of writing: </p><p> If you're a writer . . . you're a descendent of those medieval storytellers who used to go into the square of a town and spread a little mat on the ground and sit on it and beat on a bowl and say, 'If you give me a copper coin I will tell you a golden tale.' If the storyteller had what it took, he . . . told them a golden tale until it got to the most exciting point and then he passed the bowl again. </p><p> His storytelling prowess earned him frequent comparisons to Charles Dickens--a comparison of which he was not overly fond. The authors he admired included Victor Hugo, Honore de Balzac, Anthony Trollope, Evelyn Waugh, and Daniel Defoe, all very different writers, but all possessing what he called shamanstvo--the enchanter quality, from the word shaman. Like Dickens, Davies had a flair for the dramatic and could sketch a secondary character unforgettably in just a few lines (the portraits of Rev. Leadbeater, Orph Wettenhall, and Boy's stepdaughter Lorene in <b>Fifth Business</b>, for example). But he was more daring in his experiments with form than he is often given credit for, and his novelistic objectives are decidedly modern rather than Victorian. </p><p> As Michiko Kakutani wrote in the <b>New York Times</b>, Davies "has created a rich oeuvre of densely plotted, highly symbolic novels that not only function as superbly funny entertainments but also give the reader, in his character's words, a deeper kind of pleasure&#x2014; delight, awe, religious intimations, a fine sense of the past, and of the boundless depth and variety of life." </p><p> <b>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</b><br><br> 1. When Percy Boyd Staunton denies his share of responsibility for the snowball that hit Mrs. Dempster and caused her premature labor, Dunstable Ramsay feels the full weight of guilt on his shoulders. Even years later, when he seeks out Mrs. Dempster again, he is highly sensitive to the magistrate's charge: <b>"Guilt . . . somebody bears it to this day!"</b> Why does he feel this guilt so keenly? To what extent is he responsible for Paul's fate? For Staunton's?<br><br> 2. Many of the characters in <b>Fifth Business</b> change their names. Dunstable Ramsay becomes Dunstan, Percy Boyd Staunton becomes Boy Staunton, Paul Dempster becomes Faustus Legrand and later Magnus Eisengrim. What happens when each of them is "born again"? Which aspects of their characters endure, and which are transformed? <br><br> 3. Young Dunstable's flight from his mother colors the rest of his life. When he contemplates his relationship with Diana, his first lover, he shuns the motherly quality of her affection: <b>"I had no intention of being anyone's dear laddie, ever again."</b> How and why do the other men in the novel (Boy Staunton, Paul Dempster) flee their mothers? What are they seeking in a woman? How are the ideal and the reality of motherhood and womanhood conveyed in Ramsay's reflections on the virgin Mary? <br><br> 4. "People marry most happily with their own kind," Davies once wrote. "The trouble lies in the fact that people usually marry at an age where they do not really know what their own kind is." What would have happened if Dunstan had married Leola? What kind of marriage would have better suited Boy?<br><br> </p><p>5. <b>"If you think her a saint, she is a saint to you,"</b> says Padre Blazon of Ramsay's fascination with Mary Dempster. What place does she come to occupy in his psychological landscape? Why is he so possessive of her, refusing to ask for Boy's assistance for her care? <br><br> 6. King Edward VIII of England was forced to abdicate in 1936 after less than a year in office because he wanted to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American who was felt to be an unacceptable Queen. Why was this such a bitter blow to Boy? What did Edward represent to him? 7. If Ramsay is truly "<b>Fifth Business</b>," as Liesl describes, who are the hero and heroine, sorceress, and villain of the story? Do they correspond to the "<b>usual cabal</b>" described at the book's conclusion? Who are "<b>the Basso and the Brazen Head</b>" Liesl refers to in her letter? Who was the woman Boy knew and the woman he didn't know? <br><br> 8. Ganymede was a beautiful Trojan prince who was seized and carried to Olympus by Zeus's eagle to become the cup-bearer of the gods. Ramsay suggests that Boy's corporate proteges were expected to fill that role. What did he want from them, and why did they always disappoint him? <br><br> 9. "I seem to have emerged as a moralist; my novels are a moralist's novels," Davies said of his work. Certainly they are not moralistic in a conventional religious sense. In what sense are they moralistic? Ramsay tells Boy, <b>"You created a God in your own image, and when you found out he was no good you abolished him. It's a quite common form of psychological suicide."</b> What kind of God has Ramsay set up for himself? What light is shed on his moral character by his discussions of the devil? His talk with Surgeoner about fictional testimonials? <br><br> 10. <b>Fifth Business</b> has sometimes been read as an allegory of Canada's struggle for recognition and identity. Who do you think plays the part of the U. S. in this interpretation? What devils might Canada have to address to develop fully as a nation?</p><b>Robertson Davies</b> (1913-1995) had three successive careers during the time he became an internationally acclaimed author: actor, publisher, and, finally, professor at the University of Toronto.

His poems have appeared in The New Yorker, Atlantic, and American Poetry Review, among many other publications. A distinguished professor emeritus at Richard Stockton University, he lives in Frostburg, Maryland.Pulitzer-winner Dunn has, since the 1970s, offered pellucid free verse with a great deal of thought cast into deliberately plain diction, about the ups and downs, the epiphanies and the wisdom, of middle-class domestic life. This 16th book of poems and second <i>Selected</i> will certainly give loyal readers what they seek: prose poems and free-verse stanzas about small pleasures, houses and roads, disappointments, and sex, or the lack of it. One night they both needed different things/ of a similar sort: she, solace, he to be consoled, one subtle if typical poem begins; another finds Mary Shelley, the author of <i>Frankenstein</i>, almost ready to praise this awful world. In his recent poems (including 20 new ones) faithful readers will also find surprises, none harsher or more startling than the poems from <i>The Insistence of Beauty</i> (2004) about late-life divorce. Dunn also takes into his usually calm sensibility the public events of recent years&#x2014;9/11, the war in Iraq; these politicized calamities give him unsettling backdrops for his pathos, and his ongoing search for consolation: how sad it is, he imagines telling God, that awe has been replaced/ by small enthusiasms, that youre aware/ things just arent the same these days. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

An unrelenting focus on technology, hyper-short-term trading, speed, and volume has eclipsed sanity: markets have been hijacked by high-powered interests at the expense of investors and the entire capital-raising process. A small consortium of players is making billions by skimming and scalping unaware investors -- and, in so doing, they've transformed our markets from the world's envy into a barren wasteland of terror. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Since these events began, Themis Trading's Joe Saluzzi and Sal Arnuk have offered an unwavering voice of reasoned dissent.

In <i>The Order of Books</i>, Chartier examines the different systems required to regulate the world of writing through the centuries, from the registration of titles to the classification of works. The modern world has, he argues, directly inherited the products of this labor: the basic principle of referring to texts, the dream of a universal library, real or imaginary, containing all the works ever written, and the emergence of a new definition of the book leading to some of the innovations that transformed the relationship of the reader to the text. <i>The Order of Books</i> will be welcomed by students and researchers of cultural history, and the history of reading in particular.</p><p>&#x201c;Always thoughtful, analytically avant-garde without being trendy, The Order of Books is a tour de force not only in the cultural history of the book, but also in cultural history at the very point where it intersects with theory.&#x201d;&#x2014;Orest Ranum, Johns Hopkins UniversityRoger Chartier is Directeur d&#39;�tudes at the �cole des Hautes �tudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris.</p><h2>Fundamentals of Digital Logic with Verilog Design</h2><p>Used.

A sharply observed record of day-to-day life under Nazi rule in Paris and a bitter commentary on literary life in those years, it has also been called "a remarkable essay on courage and cowardice" (Caroline Moorehead, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>). Here, David Ball provides not only the first English-translation of this important historical document, but also the first ever annotated, corrected edition.<br> <br>Gu�henno was a well-known political and cultural critic, left-wing but not communist, and uncompromisingly anti-fascist. Unlike most French writers during the Occupation, he refused to pen a word for a publishing industry under Nazi control. He expressed his intellectual, moral, and emotional resistance in this diary: his shame at the Vichy government's collaboration with Nazi Germany, his contempt for its falsely patriotic reactionary ideology, his outrage at its anti-Semitism and its vilification of the Republic it had abolished, his horror at its increasingly savage repression and his disgust with his fellow intellectuals who kept on blithely writing about art and culture as if the Occupation did not exist - not to mention those who praised their new masters in prose and poetry. Also a teacher of French literature, he constantly observed the young people he taught, sometimes saddened by their conformism but always passionately trying to inspire them with the values of the French cultural tradition he loved. Gu�henno's diary often includes his own reflections on the great texts he is teaching, instilling them with special meaning in the context of the Occupation. Complete with meticulous notes and a biographical index, Ball's edition of Gu�henno's epic diary offers readers a deeper understanding not only of the diarist's cultural allusions, but also of the dramatic, historic events through which he lived.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jean Gu�henno</strong> was a French writer and intellectual.<br><br><strong>David Ball</strong> is Professor Emeritus of French and Comparative Literature, Smith College.<br><br>"This first English translation of Gu�henno's diary offers a new and important lens through which to understand the experience of foreign occupation. Those who teach about the occupation through English-language texts and their students will warmly welcome this edition of the diary. So will a wider audience of readers who have an interest in French history and culture, especially those who are eager to know more about war and occupation from a personal, closely observed, grass roots perspective."--Sandra Ott, <em>H-France</em><p></p><br>"A model writer and intellectual who neither collaborated nor accommodated the enemy, [Gu�henno] refused to publish a single word as long as his country was under Nazi control. A leading essayist of the Popular Front, regularly skewered by the far right, he vowed, as of July 1940, to confine his thoughts and feelings to a private journal. It is a mystery why 'Diary of the Dark Years, 1940-1944,' first published in 1947 and still a standard reference in France, is only now appearing in English in a fine translation by David Ball....Mr. Ball, who has succeeded in giving Gu�henno's grand diction the emotional charge it has in the original French, has provided extensive notes, as well as a biographical dictionary, so that no reference is left obscure."--<em>The New York Times</em><p></p><br>"Compelling....[C]risply translated, a fascinating blend of inward monologue and acute exterior observations."--<em>Wall Street Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"I was struck repeatedly by the beauty, the passion, the elegance of Gu�henno's words as rendered in English....For today's readers, <em>Diary of the Dark Years, 1940-1944</em> is not just a cautionary tale about freedom lost but a thought-provoking story of how an abiding love of country and determined courage can help regain it."--<em>Chicago Tribune</em><p></p><br>"Every once in a while, however, an extraordinary document comes along to remind us that the books matter. The diary kept by the French writer and critic Jean Gu�henno during the German occupation of France from 1940 to 1944 is one such document....[A] genuinely important and enthralling book, and its publication in English in an excellent, fluid, and expertly annotated translation by David Ball is a welcome and long overdue event."--<em>The New Republic</em><p></p><br>"This first English translation flows easily, greatly aided by both a biographical dictionary and Ball's explanatory footnotes regarding historical events. Easily adaptable for class/group readings, Gu�henno's diary, first published in 1947, emotionally depicts WWII through his despair over France's invasion; wry observations of the 'gray men' populating the darkened, desolate city; exhaustion and, ultimately, joy."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em>, starred review<p></p><br>"Ball's work...is exemplary. Ball does full justice to the powerful prose of Gu�henno, a highly principled man of letters and teacher of literature who refused to published a single line as long as his country endured 'the anguish of servitude'....Essential."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"[A] significant book, now made accessible to an anglophone audience in what is a powerful translation....[<em>Diary of the Dark Years</em>] is a rewarding work worth savouring slowly, as you dip into the life and mind of Jean Gu�henno."--<em>H-France</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Cambridge Companion to Shakespearean Comedy (Cambridge Companions to Literature)</h2><p>This introduction examines the continuity and variety of Shakepeare&#39;s work and the creative use he made of his inherited conventions.

Focussing on the principle that one can outsmart your foe mentally by thinking very carefully about strategy before resorting to physical battle, this philosophy continues to be applied to the corporate and business world. Sun Tzu&#39;s timeless appraisal of the different aspects of warfare are laid out in 13 chapters, including sections on &#39;Laying Plans&#39;, &#39;Waging War&#39; and &#39;Terrain&#39;. Words that are as resonant today in every aspect of our lives as they were when he wrote them.</p><p><i>The Art of War</i> was written over 2,300 years ago in what is now North China. Yet it still remains a contemporary lesson on how to attain victory without going to battle. Modern-day warriors find its ancient strategies helpful regardless of whether the conflict dwells in the boardroom or the bedroom. Despite numerous references to enemies, generals, and armies, <i>The Art of War</i> is about nonaggression. At its core, <i>The Art of War</i> offers a sophisticated lesson on "taking whole," meaning staying openhearted and relaxed in order to sidestep a fight--whether you are a field commander, a CEO, or a frustrated mother putting a resistant son to bed. This particular translation comes from the Denma Translation Group, led by scholars Kidder Smith and James Gimian (publisher of <i>Shambhala Sun</i> magazine). Because of the text's obscure wording (even the Chinese find the original document cumbersome), the translators have inserted helpful commentary that removes some of the linguistic barriers. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Here is a seminal work on the philosophy of successful leadership that is as applicable to contemporary business as it is to war. James Clavell has taken a 1910 translation and clarified it for the contemporary reader.</p><h2>Basketball, Multiple Offense and Defense</h2><p>Explains how coaches can help their players develop the right mental attitude, and describes a variety of offensive and defensive plays</p><p><p> This book contains the coaching blueprint and philosophy of the man who won more college-level games than any other basketball coach in history! </p><p><br>* Contains analytical and innovative coaching strategies <br>* Includes Bob Spear's special section on the Shuffle Offense <br>* Includes new, updated photos <br> This book contains the secrets, strategies, and techniques that produced the greatest winning tradition in college basketball and will produce results and successes for coaches and players at all levels.

With the collapse of the bi-polar world of the Cold War, there has also been a parallel rise in the subnational--the claims of local, regional, and ethnic minorities--economic globalization, American cultural hegemony, international migration, and diasporization. In <em>Becoming National</em> Eley and Suny, two of the foremost authorities on nationalism, acknowledge these changes by combinging a diverse selection of readings with a unifying introduction and instructive headnotes, creating a text that moves the discussion of nationalism onto a new and contemporary level. Each group of readings is introduced by a brief historical essay, and the readings are fully annotated. Emphasizing the recent intellectual advances and influential ideas of Miroslav Hroch, Benedict Anderson, Paul Gilroy, Stuart Hall, Lauren Berlant, and a host of others, this book underscores the nineteenth and twentieth century nationalist theories to show not only where scholars of nationalism have been but where they are going. Drawing on the strengths of recent cultural studies, including race and gender identities, the editors show that though politics is the ground upon which nationalism is constructed, culture is the terrain on which it is elaborated and fought over.<br></p><p>Being national is the condition of our times, yet never before has the idea of the nation been under such scrutiny.

In a text as epic in scope as its subject, and drawing on exclusive interviews with actors and filmmakers conducted specifically for the American Cinema project, author Jeanine Basinger presents the evolution of the Hollywood saga, from its early roots in rural California to an industry that has adapted to - and thrived during - such metamorphoses as the advent of sound, the "threat" of foreign films and of television, and even the age of the conglomerate.<br>Basinger examines in depth the language of film - focusing on the nature of the art form during the "golden age" as well as in the age of television - and its power, in Hollywood's skilled hands, to keep you in your seat and forever coming back for more.<br>With more than 300 illustrations from the world's leading film archives, including some never before published, this book celebrates the best of American films, from the glamorous defining films of Hollywood in such favorite genres as the screwball comedy and the western to today's blockbusters and film-school generation of directors, Scorsese, Spielberg, DePalma, Lucas, and Coppola. Also included are the new filmmakers redefining the Hollywood film today.</p><p>Jeanine Basinger is Chair of the Film Studies program and Corwin-Fuller Professor of Film Studies at Wesleyan University.Though Europe was perhaps first in capturing moving images on celluloid strips, Hollywood invented "The Movies." Film is one of our nation's few native art forms, and as this book amply illustrates, we could have done worse. Although essentially a tie-in to a PBS series of the same name, this luscious coffee-table volume stands well on its own. In 13 chapters, film scholar Basinger covers a century of domestic filmmaking, from Edison's 1894 capturing of a man's sneeze to recent full-length features. Fans of old classics and those of modern films will find something of interest as the text surveys both the film-factory world of the long-deceased studio system and today's independent productions. The text, which not only follows the history of film but dabbles in its sociology and psychology as well, is buttressed with 300 photographs (100 in color)-some standards, some new. Basinger rounds up the usual information, but there's an equal amount of original material on today's movies and stars here, making this a worthy purchase for large film collections. Smaller collections may wait to see how much interest the PBS series generates before ordering.

Original.</p><p>&#34;Sheer good storytelling ... from opening tragedy to concluding triumph . . . an imaginative and captivating story&#34;. -- Publishers Weekly</p><h2>The City in Slang: New York Life and Popular Speech</h2><p>The American urban scene, and in particular New York's, has given us a rich cultural legacy of slang words and phrases, a bonanza of popular speech. <em>Hot dog</em>, <em>rush hour</em>, <em>butter-and-egg man</em>, <em>gold digger</em>, <em>shyster</em>, <em>buttinsky</em>, <em>smart aleck</em>, <em>sidewalk superintendent</em>, <em>yellow journalism</em>, <em>breadline</em>, <em>straphanger</em>, <em>tar beach</em>, <em>the Tenderloin</em>, <em>the Great White Way</em>, <em>to do a Brodie</em>--these are just a few of the hundreds of popular words and phrases that were born or took on new meaning in the streets of New York.<br> In <em>The City in Slang</em>, Irving Lewis Allen traces this flowering of popular expressions that accompanied the emergence of the New York metropolis beginning in the early nineteenth century, providing in effect a lexicon of popular speech about city life as well as a unique account of the cultural and social history of America's greatest city. He shows how this vocabulary arose from city streets, often interplaying with vaudeville, radio, movies, comics, and the popular songs of Tin Pan Alley.<br> Some terms of great pertinence to city people today have unexpectedly old pedigrees. <em>Rush hour</em> was coined by 1890, for instance, and <em>rubberneck</em> dates to the late 1890s and became popular in New York to describe the busloads of tourists who craned their necks to see the tall buildings and the sights of the Bowery and Chinatown. <em>The Big Apple</em> itself (since 1971 the official nickname of New York) appeared in the 1920s, though first in reference to the city's top racetracks and to Broadway bookings as pinnacles of professional endeavor. Allen also tells fascinating stories behind once-popular slang that is no longer in use. <em>Spielers</em>, for example, were the little girls in tenement districts who danced ecstatically on the sidewalks to the music of the hurdy-gurdy men and, when they were old enough, frequented the dance halls of the Lower East Side.<br> Following the trail of these words and phrases into the city's East Side, West Side, and all around the town, from Harlem to Wall Street, and into the haunts of its high and low life, <em>The City in Slang</em> is a fascinating look at the rich cultural heritage of language about city life.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Irving Lewis Allen</strong> is Professor of Sociology at the University of Connecticut, Storrs.<br>New Yorkers hail a "cab" because of the one-horse, two-wheeled European carriage called a cabriolet. The "flappers" of the 1920s were named after fledgling ducks, and the original "skyscrapers" were mere 16-story buildings. University of Connecticut sociology professor Allen has researched the origin of slang words commonly used today and in the past, and has produced an unusual and interesting cultural history of urban life. By dividing his study into such categories as "The Sporting Life," "Tall Buildings" and "The Social Meaning of City Streets," he draws connections between a diverse, rapidly changing metropolis and the language that its citizens have used to explain themselves to each other and to the outside world. A readable study of interest to urban and cultural historians and linguists as well as a general audience.

He mulled this revolutionary idea over for several years, first with his close friend the novelist William Golding, and then in an extensive collaboration with the American scientist Lynn Margulis. In the early 1970s, he finally went public with the Gaia hypothesis, the idea that everything happens for an end: the good of planet Earth. Lovelock and Margulis were scorned by professional scientists, but the general public enthusiastically embraced Lovelock and his hypothesis. People joined Gaia groups; churches had Gaia services, sometimes with new music written especially for the occasion. There was a Gaia atlas, Gaia gardening, Gaia herbs, Gaia retreats, Gaia networking, and much more. And the range of enthusiasts was&#x2014;and still is&#x2014;broad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>The Gaia Hypothesis</i>, philosopher Michael Ruse, with his characteristic clarity and wit, uses Gaia and its history, its supporters and detractors, to illuminate the nature of science itself. Gaia emerged in the 1960s, a decade when authority was questioned and status and dignity stood for nothing, but its story is much older. Ruse traces Gaia&#x2019;s connection to Plato and a long history of goal-directed and holistic&#x2014;or organicist&#x2014;thinking and explains why Lovelock and Margulis&#x2019;s peers rejected it as pseudoscience. But Ruse also shows why the project was a success. He argues that Lovelock and Margulis should be commended for giving philosophy firm scientific basis and for provoking important scientific discussion about the world as a whole, its homeostasis or&#x2014;in this age of global environmental uncertainty&#x2014;its lack thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melding the world of science and technology with the world of feeling, mysticism, and religion, <i>The Gaia Hypothesis </i>will appeal to a broad range of readers, from students and scholars of the history and philosophy of science to anyone interested in New Age culture.<br></p><p><b>Michael Ruse</b> is director of the Program in the History and Philosophy of Science at Florida State University.&#x201c;[Ruse&#x2019;s] treatment is thought-provoking and original, as you would expect from this perceptive, irrepressible philosopher of biology.&#x201d; (<i>New Scientist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Fascinating. . . . The book is full of empathetic, insightful, and often very funny portraits of Margulis, Lovelock, and a community of other figures associated with Gaia and its histories. It is also a wonderfully lively and readable narrative.&#x201d; (Carla Nappi <i>New Books in Science, Technology, and Society</i>)<br><br>"Explores the philosophical and historical bases of Gaia&#x2019;s principle, beginning with Plato and taking readers up to the present with modern ecology and evolutionary biology. . . . There are few people writing today more qualified than Ruse to take on this job. He has the history and philosophical skills to tackle the literature across millennia, and his three-decade immersion in evolution allows him to read critically from complicated sources. Best of all, he still knows how to write in a way that makes philosophy and science fun." (<i>Quarterly Review of Biology</i>)<br><br>"A good read, with genuine insights into the characters and careers of Lovelock and Margulis and the general Zeitgeist that accounted for the positive reception of the Gaia hypothesis by the general public." (Eugene Cittadino, New York University <i>Isis</i>)<br><br>"Anyone interested in the Gaia hypothesis--its history, its philosophical underpinnings and the scientific controversy over it in the mid-twentieth-century--will find this book an exceptionally interesting read." (Paul Thompson <i>Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences</i>)<br><br>"Fascinating. . . . A refreshing reminder of just how much the scientific enterprise is a social phenomenon, both in its inner workings and in how it is affected by the broader social milieu." (Massimo Pigliucci, City University of New York <i>Ethics and the Environment</i>)<br><br>"Written with Ruse&#x2019;s usual flair and attention to the relevant evidence (that he shows is itself rich and varied), this book is scholarly and illuminating, on the one hand, and a thoroughly enjoyable read, on the other." (Lynn Hankinson Nelson, University of Washington <i>Soundings: An Interdisciplinary Journal</i>)<br><br>"Original, well researched, timely, and well written. . . . In short, The Gaia Hypothesis is highly recommended reading." (Arthur C. Peterson, University College London <i>European Society for the Study of Science and Theology</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Entertaining and highly readable. . . . The value of Ruse&#x2019;s book is in how he captures the wider importance of the debate triggered by the Gaia hypothesis. Like all good philosophers, he makes the reader think about how we think.&#x201d; (Tim Lenton, University of Exeter <i>BioScience</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Few philosophers have blended the history and philosophy of science more successfully than Michael Ruse. And no contemporary scholar has played a more active role in establishing and maintaining the boundaries of science. In this riveting examination of the Gaia hypothesis&#x2014;that is, the claim that Earth is a living planet&#x2014;Ruse even-handedly applies his expertise to dissecting a controversial case where science, pseudoscience, and religion all came into play.&#x201d;<br> (Ronald L.

After a false start as a painter of miniatures, Catlin found his calling: to fix the image of a &#x201c;vanishing race&#x201d; before their &#x201c;extermination&#x201d;&#x2015;his word&#x2015;by a government greedy for their lands. In the first six years of the 1830s, he created over six hundred portraits&#x2015;unforgettable likenesses of individual chiefs, warriors, braves, squaws, and children belonging to more than thirty tribes living along the upper Missouri River. <p>Political forces thwarted Catlin&#x2019;s ambition to sell what he called his &#x201c;Indian Gallery&#x201d; as a national collection, and in 1840 the artist began three decades of self-imposed exile abroad. For a time, his exhibitions and writings made him the most celebrated American expatriate in London and Paris. He was toasted by Queen Victoria and breakfasted with King Louis-Philippe, who created a special gallery in the Louvre to show his pictures. But when he started to tour &#x201c;live&#x201d; troupes of Ojibbewa and Iowa, Catlin and his fortunes declined: He changed from artist to showman, and from advocate to exploiter of his native performers. Tragedy and loss engulfed both.</p><p>This brilliant and humane portrait brings to life George Catlin and his Indian subjects for our own time.

Bulosan's semi-autobiographical novel <i>America is in the Heart</i> begins with the narrator's rural childhood in the Philippines and the struggles of land-poor peasant families affected by US imperialism after the Spanish American War of the late 1890s. Carlos's experiences with other Filipino migrant laborers, who endured intense racial abuse in the fields, orchards, towns, cities and canneries of California and the Pacific Northwest in the 1930s, reexamine the ideals of the American dream. Bulosan was one of the most important 20th century social critics with his deeply moving account of what it was like to be criminalized in the U.S. as a Filipino migrant drawn to the ideals of what America symbolized and committed to social justice for all marginalized groups.<br><br><b>Celebrate Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month with these three Penguin Classics:</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>America Is in the Heart </i>by Carlos Bulosan (9780143134039)<br> <i>East Goes West </i>by Younghill Kang (9780143134305)<br> <i>The Hanging on Union Square </i>by H.

From 1930 to 1956, Bulosan developed into a leading Filipino writer in the United States committed to social justice. Bulosan established his position as a major Filipino writer with <i>The Laughter of My Father</i> (1944) and <i>America Is in the Heart</i> (1946). An iconic figure of Filipino American literature, Bulosan was recovered by the Asian American movement and the Philippine national sovereignty movement of the 1970s. A pioneering Filipino writer-activist in the United States, Bulosan is an iconic figure of Filipino American literature and Filipino American labor history.<br><br><b>Elaine Castillo</b> was born in the San Francisco Bay Area.

He walked with measured steps and when he reached the spreading mango tree that separated our land from my grandfather's, he put his bundle on the ground and sat on it, looking toward our house with the anxiety of a man who had been away from home for a long time. He was as yet unrecognizable in the early morning light, but it was evident from the way he walked that he had come a long distance. Apparently he was not a stranger in our barrio or village, for he seemed to know where he was going and to be unhurried.<br><br>I rushed out of the house and ran across the pasture where some of our animals were grazing. I headed for the rich piece of land my father was plowing. It was the season for corn and my father, like the other farmers in our barrio, had gone to our land at early dawn to start the spring plowing. I could smell the fresh upturned earth in the air and the bitter smoke of burning grass. The fields were dotted with men plowing and harrowing and raking weeds into the river.<br><br>My father halted the carabao, or water buffalo, and bit the rope. He put his wet hands on his hips and waited patiently for me. When I reached him, I leaned against the carabao and gasped for breath. The kind animal turned his head toward me and switched the flies off his back with his long tail.<br><br>"What is it, son?" asked my father, taking, the rope from his mouth and tying it to the plow handle. "Why are you running like a hound so early in the morning?"<br><br>"I think I saw brother Leon," I said, hoping that I was right about the stranger who resembled my oldest brother. "I saw him coming toward our house."<br><br>Father kicked the dirt off his feet and said: "Your brother Leon is still fighting in Europe. Maybe he is dead now. I have not heard from him." He took the rope again and flipped it gently and suggestively across the carabao's back, and the two of them, the patient animal and my father, walked slowly and industriously away, the sharp plow blade breaking smoothly through the rich soil between them.<br><br>I ran to the tamarind at the other end of the farm and climbed quickly to its top. I looked toward the mango tree, but the stranger was no longer there. I looked around as far as my eyes could see. Then I saw him coming toward our land with slow, firm steps, stopping now and then to look at the surrounding landscape. He was coming from the direction of our house.<br><br>When the carabao had reached the ditch and was trying to snatch a tuft of grass, I shouted to father to stop and look toward the stranger. He put the rope between his teeth, but when he saw the stranger and recognized him, his mouth opened in surprise and the rope fell to the wet ground. I climbed down the tree hurriedly and ran as fast as I could across the plowed earth. My father was already talking with the stranger.<br><br>I stopped suddenly when I saw my brother Leon. I had seen only his picture on the large table in our house in town. I did not know what to say now that I was seeing him for the first time. My father looked at me and his face broke into sudden gentleness.<br><br>"It is your brother, son," he said, picking up the rope. "He is home now, from the war."<br><br>"Welcome home, soldier," I said.<br><br>Leon grabbed my shoulders and swung me swiftly above his head; then he put me back on the ground and looked blank for a moment. Suddenly, with an affectionate glance at the animal, he took the rope from my father and started plowing the common earth that had fed our family for generations.<br><br>That was how I met my brother who had gone to fight a strange war in Europe. The sudden, sweeping years that later came to my life and pushed me into the unknown, the vital, negative years of hard work and bitter trials oftentimes resurrected his face for me with great vividness. And at other times I was to go back again and again to this moment for an assurance of righteous anger against the crushing terror that filled my life in a land far away. . . .<br><br>It was springtime when my brother Leon came back to our barrio, in the little farming town of Binalonan, on the island of Luzon. I must have been five years old at the time, but I remember vividly those first days when he stayed with us. He immediately discarded his khaki army uniform and opened the small trunk where he had put his old clothes before he went away. He followed the plow again and worked patiently with us, hoping, as the weeks passed into months, and the corn grew tall and ripened, that we would have a good crop.<br><br>But the Philippines was undergoing a radical social change; all over the archipelago the younger generation was stirring and adapting new attitudes. And although for years the agitation for national independence had been growing, the government was actually in the hands of powerful native leaders. It was such a juicy issue that obscure men with ample education exploited it to their own advantage, thus slowly but inevitably plunging the nation into a great economic catastrophe that tore the islands from their roots, and obfuscated the people's resurgence toward a broad national unity.<br><br>For a time it seemed that the younger generation, influenced by false American ideals and modes of living, had become total strangers to the older generation. In the provinces where the poor peasants lived and toiled for the rich hacienderos, or landlords, the young men were stirring and rebelling against their heritage. Those who could no longer tolerate existing conditions adventured into the new land, for the opening of the United States to them was one of the gratifying provisions of the peace treaty that culminated the Spanish-American War.<br><br>At this time we had four hectares of land, which were barely sufficient to keep our family from starving. We had crop rotation as an insurance against starvation, and the generosity of the soil was miraculous. In the spring we planted corn and beans and a few rows of tobacco; we harvested our crops toward the rainy season and stored them in the granary. Then we planted rice and fattened our animals in the grassy forest at the edge of the barrio; and sometimes, when the rice was growing rapidly under the warm rains, we would go to a wedding or a christening party.<br><br>Then my brother Leon met the girl who became his wife. She came from a poor family in the north, in the province of Ilocos Sur, where the peasants were overcrowded in a narrow barren land. She came to our barrio and hired herself to one of the farmers who had more hectares of land than the others. Because she came from a thrifty and industrious people, the villagers liked her and they tried wisely, before my brother Leon returned from the war, to bring their eligible sons to her attention. Fortunately my brother came back before she was betrothed, and in no time they became engaged to be married.<br><br>I do not remember the exact details of my brother's marriage, but I remember my father's immediate approval and great joy. I remember how I sat on a bamboo chair in the dancing pavilion, between the bride and the groom, watching the peasant boys and girls dancing in bare feet. It must have been the third day of the wedding, because the women in the kitchen were already putting away the plates and the large wooden bowls used as rice receptacles on the long dining table. The men were moving away the chairs, piling them into oxcarts and sleds, and giving them back to the people from whom they had been borrowed. The merrymakers, who had sat at the tables earlier that day eating rice with their bare hands and washing their mouths in a large bowl that was passed around the tables, were scattering in the yard and waiting for the momentous hour of the wedding.<br><br>It was the time for the groom to carry his bride to the new house which had been built especially for them in the yard, near the little grass hut where my father and I lived. He would then find out if his wife were virginal. When I was growing up in the barrio of Mangusmana this primitive custom was still prevalent, although in the town of Binalonan itself, of which our barrio was merely a part, it had never existed. The custom had come down to the peasants in the valleys from the hill people who had intermarried with the villagers and had imposed their own traditions.<br><br>The ritual was very simple. But it was also the most dramatic of the series of colorful wedding events. My brother Leon carried his wife across the harvested fields to their new home. We followed, shouting with joy and throwing rice upon them. We stopped in the yard when they entered the house. Then we waited silently, anxious to see the black smoke come out of the house, for it would mean that the bride was a virgin. If no smoke showed, we would know that the groom had been deceived, and we would justify his action if he returned the girl to her people. It was a cruel custom, because the women could no longer marry when they were returned to their parents, and would be looked upon with abhorrence and would be ostracized. But it was a fast-dying custom, in line with other backward customs in the Philippines, yielding to the new ways of the younger generation that were shaping out sharply from the growing industrialism.<br><br>I do not think the smoke came out of the house where my brother and his bride were alone, because I remember the crowd milling around my father and rushing into the house. The men brought the girl out and tied her to a guava tree. The angry women spat in her eyes and tore off her clothes, calling her obscene names. When one of the men rushed out of the toolshed with a horsewhip, my father frantically fought his way through the crowd. He had hardly reached the girl when a man knocked him down, and he was trampled upon by angry feet.<br><br>The men must also have knocked down my brother Leon in the house. I saw him staggering toward his bride with blood on his face. He flung himself upon her, covering her bleeding body with his, and the stones and sticks fell upon him mercilessly. Then they tied him to the tree, beside his bride, and the angry peasants, who had been his good friends and neighbors a moment ago, began throwing stones at them.<br><br>My father crawled on his knees and flung himself upon my brother and his bride.<br><br>"Stop, you devils!" he shouted helplessly. "She is a good, industrious woman, and my son wants to live with her!"<br><br>But the whips began falling upon him. A deep gash was cut across his face and blood came out of his mouth. I could no longer hear what he was saying. The shouting became deafening and the cries of the girl were drowned by that horrible human sound. Then the crowd went away, still angry but spent.<br><br>I fumbled in the dark with the bolo or butcher knife, cutting the ropes that bound them to the guava tree. It was now far into the night, and the stars were few and faraway. The sky was like a field of dying fire trees, vast and remote in the night. The girl flung her bleeding arms about my brother and wept silently. I saw my father's face searching for an answer in the earth to the unanswerable question in my brother's eyes.<br><br>I will never forget how my brother lifted the girl in his arms, as ceremoniously and gently as he had done that afternoon, and carried her tenderly into their house to begin a new life.<br><br>Not long afterward my brother Leon, who had already sold one hectare of our land, which was his share of the family property, left the barrio with his wife to live in another part of Luzon. I saw him again on my way to America, but he was then a mature man with children of his own. I had written him that I would pass through his town on my way to Manila, and had asked him, if he would, to stand in front of his house and wait for my bus. In those days there was only one bus a day from Binalonan to the train station, in the town of Dagupan. I could at least look through the window of my bus and wave good-bye to him.<br><br>When my bus came to the white saltbeds, I knew that I was nearing the place where my brother Leon lived. I saw the mango grove and the shining fish ponds beyond it, near the mouth of the Agno River that opens lazily into Lingayen gulf. At the edge of the shimmering plain, standing like a huge mushroom by the highway, was my brother's grass house. My heart began to beat faster as I drew nearer; eagerly I leaned out of the window.<br><br>Then I saw him, then his small wife, and then his children. They were standing in front of their house-the father first, then the mother, and then the children. They waved good-bye to me, all of them; and I leaned far out the window, waving to them. It was good-bye to my brother Leon and to the war that he had fought in a strange land; good-bye to his silent wife and all that was magnificent in her. It was only several hours afterward that I tried to recall how many children were beside my brother.</p><h2>The Woven Figure: Conservatism and America&#39;s Fabric</h2><p>In a collection of essays, the author addresses such topics as inflation, the Gingrich revolution, and the arrogance of government and its inability to correct human nature</p><p>The sixth collection of George Will's syndicated op-ed columns finds the iconic conservative pundit complaining about abuse of the battered-woman syndrome defense and other "excuses" offered up in courts, overglorification of multiculturalism, the double entendres on <i>Friends</i> in the months before the 1996 presidential election, and an assortment of other manifestations of declining cultural values.

This model builds on the advances made by dynamic psychotherapy, without involving the patient in a lengthy uncovering and reconstruction of childhood trauma. Instead, Basch describes how the therapist can reframe each patient's dynamics and then use the strengths revealed to offset the patient's difficulties. This approach allows each patient to confront life's problems not as a hapless victim of circumstance, past or present, but as a proactive agent for change.To illustrate his new approach, Basch includes several absorbing case examples throughout the book. His straightforward explanation of the principles that govern effective intervention allow the method to be readily adapted by both the beginner and the experienced clinician.</p><p><b>Michael Franz Basch, M.D.,</b> is the Cynthia Oudejans Harris, M.D., Professor of Psychiatry at Rush Medical College in Chicago, the training and supervising psychoanalyst at the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis, and is in the private practice of psychiatry and psychoanalysis.

In addition, Leonard Feather provides a chronology, list of international critic polls, musicians birthdays and birthplaces, a bibliography, and a discography of recommended recordings. For anyone seriously--or even casually--interested in the development of jazz and blues, this classic reference work can guide you unerringly through the many dimensions of the music's wonderful history.</p><p><b>Leonard Feather</b> is one of the handful of indispensable jazz critics.

Despite the fact that it's often a hard sell at first (what teenager wouldn't cringe at the thought of 400-plus pages of talking rabbits?), Richard Adams's bunny-centric epic rarely fails to win the love and respect of anyone who reads it, regardless of age. Like most great novels, <i>Watership Down</i> is a rich story that can be read (and reread) on many different levels. The book is often praised as an allegory, with its analogs between human and rabbit culture (a fact sometimes used to goad skeptical teens, who resent the challenge that they won't "get" it, into reading it), but it's equally praiseworthy as just a corking good adventure.<p> The story follows a warren of Berkshire rabbits fleeing the destruction of their home by a land developer. As they search for a safe haven, skirting danger at every turn, we become acquainted with the band and its compelling culture and mythos. Adams has crafted a touching, involving world in the dirt and scrub of the English countryside, complete with its own folk history and language (the book comes with a "lapine" glossary, a guide to rabbitese). As much about freedom, ethics, and human nature as it is about a bunch of bunnies looking for a warm hidey-hole and some mates, <i>Watership Down</i> will continue to make the transition from classroom desk to bedside table for many generations to come. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Paris 1650-1900: Decorative Arts in the Rijksmuseum</h2><p><p>From 1650 to 1900 Paris was the undisputed center of fashion and taste in Europe.

The theory developed in this book by two specialists in the field can be applied to the study of such diverse astrophysical phenomena as stellar winds, supernova explosions, and the initial phases of cosmic expansion, as well as the physics of laser fusion and reentry vehicles. As such, it provides students with the basic tools for research on radiating flows.<br>Largely self-contained, the volume is divided into three parts: Chapters 1 to 5 focus on the dynamics of nonradiating fluids and then consider applications of a few astrophysically interesting problems concerning waves, shocks, and stellar winds. The second part of the book &#x2014; Chapters 5 to 8 &#x2014; deals with the physics of radiation, radiation transport, and the dynamics of radiating fluids, emphasizing the close relationship of radiation hydrodynamics to ordinary fluid dynamics. Part 3 comprises a short appendix on tensor calculus, explaining the use of tensor concepts in writing equations that allow a simple transition from ordinary fluids to relativistic fluids to radiation.<br>Combining relevant material scattered widely among a large number of books, journal papers, and technical reports, this volume will be of immense value to students and researchers in many fields. <br>1984 edition.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Golden Notebook</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Much to its author's chagrin, <i>The Golden Notebook</i> instantly became a staple of the feminist movement when it was published in 1962. Doris Lessing's novel deconstructs the life of Anna Wulf, a sometime-Communist and a deeply leftist writer living in postwar London with her small daughter. Anna is battling writer's block, and, it often seems, the damaging chaos of life itself. The elements that made the book remarkable when it first appeared--extremely candid sexual and psychological descriptions of its characters and a fractured, postmodern structure--are no longer shocking. Nevertheless, <i>The Golden Notebook</i> has retained a great deal of power, chiefly due to its often brutal honesty and the sheer variation and sweep of its prose.<p> This largely autobiographical work comprises Anna's four notebooks: "a black notebook which is to do with Anna Wulf the writer; a red notebook concerned with politics; a yellow notebook, in which I make stories out of my experience; and a blue notebook which tries to be a diary." In a brilliant act of verisimilitude, Lessing alternates between these notebooks instead of presenting each one whole, also weaving in a novel called <i>Free Women</i>, which views Anna's life from the omniscient narrator's point of view. As the novel draws to a close, Anna, in the midst of a breakdown, abandons her dependence on compartmentalization and writes the single golden notebook of the title.</p><p> In tracking Anna's psychological movements--her recollections of her years in Africa, her relationship with her best friend, Molly, her travails with men, her disillusionment with the Party, the tidal pull of motherhood--Lessing pinpoints the pulse of a generation of women who were waiting to see what their postwar hopes would bring them. What arrived was unprecedented freedom, but with that freedom came unprecedented confusion. Lessing herself said in a 1994 interview: "I say fiction is better than telling the truth. Because the point about life is that it's a mess, isn't it? It hasn't got any shape except for you're born and you die." </p><p> <i>The Golden Notebook</i> suffers from certain weaknesses, among them giving rather simplistic, overblown illustrations to the phrase "a good man is hard to find" in the form of an endless parade of weak, selfish men. But it still has the capacity to fill emotional voids with the great rushes of feeling it details. Perhaps this is because it embodies one of Anna's own revelations: "I've been forced to acknowledge that the flashes of genuine art are all out of deep, suddenly stark, undisguiseable private emotion. Even in translation there is no mistaking these lightning flashes of genuine personal feeling." It seems that Lessing, like Anna when she decides to abandon her notebooks for the single, golden one, attempted to put all of herself in one book. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>doris lessing is widely recognized as one of the greatest writers of the second half of the twentieth century.</p><h2>Calculus and Its Applications (2nd Edition)</h2><p><p> <i>For two-semester courses in Applied Calculus.&nbsp;</i> </p> <p> <br> </p> <p> <b>Anticipating and meeting student needs</b> </p> <p> <b> <i>Calculus and Its Applications&nbsp;</i> </b>remains a best-selling text because of its intuitive approach that anticipates student needs, and a writing style that pairs clear explanations with carefully crafted figures to help students visualize concepts.

The immediate result was a glut of dense, abstract books on the "nature of man." But the dawning "age of the crisis of man," as Mark Greif calls it, was far more than a historical curiosity. In this ambitious intellectual and literary history, Greif recovers this lost line of thought to show how it influenced society, politics, and culture before, during, and long after World War II.</p><p>During the 1930s and 1940s, fears of the barbarization of humanity energized New York intellectuals, Chicago protoconservatives, European Jewish �migr�s, and native-born bohemians to seek "re-enlightenment," a new philosophical account of human nature and history. After the war this effort diffused, leading to a rebirth of modern human rights and a new power for the literary arts.</p><p>Critics' predictions of a "death of the novel" challenged writers to invest bloodless questions of human nature with flesh and detail. Hemingway, Faulkner, and Richard Wright wrote flawed novels of abstract man. Succeeding them, Ralph Ellison, Saul Bellow, Flannery O'Connor, and Thomas Pynchon constituted a new guard who tested philosophical questions against social realities&#x2015;race, religious faith, and the rise of technology&#x2015;that kept difference and diversity alive.</p><p>By the 1960s, the idea of "universal man" gave way to moral antihumanism, as new sensibilities and social movements transformed what had come before. Greif's reframing of a foundational debate takes us beyond old antagonisms into a new future, and gives a prehistory to the fractures of our own era.</p></p><p><p>"Mark Greif's original and compelling history of the 'crisis of man' shows how important this debate was not just to American intellectual life in the middle of the twentieth century, but to the postmodernity that was to follow, and to theoretical questions that still engage us. Through a series of dazzling readings, Greif shows that literature, not theory or philosophy, provided by far the best analyses of the problem of the nature and future of 'man.' Anyone interested in theories of human rights and the posthuman, in the constant tug of war between universalism and difference, or in the relationship between literature and philosophy should read this book."<b>--Toril Moi, Duke University</b></p><p>"This book offers more than a fine history of midcentury intellectual life. A set of ideas that have long seemed deader than the paper they are printed on are given, not credence, but a thrilling sense of energy and urgency. The strength of the conceptual framework lets one see how the restless ghosts of the 'age of the crisis of man' have been keeping us company all along. Against the odds, Greif's account provides us with new tools for understanding our present, when the category of the human has never seemed a less reliable beacon to the making of a better world."<b>--Mark McGurl, author of <i>The Program Era: Postwar Fiction and the Rise of Creative Writing</i></b></p><p>"Mark Greif is one of my favorite contemporary essayists, and it's a pleasure to read his analysis of a time of change so fundamental to our culture and artworks today. This is a brilliant history of midcentury American (and European) thought. His writing is witty, profound, and able to change the inner landscape of anyone who encounters it."<b>--Sheila Heti, author of <i>How Should a Person Be?</i></b></p><p>"An utterly surprising prehistory of our present, and one of the best imaginable roadmaps to the intellectual and literary geography of the last seventy years."<b>--Elaine Scarry, Harvard University</b></p><p>"This is a substantial, even brilliant, contribution to the literary history of midcentury America. Mark Greif is a bold, idea-intensive critic."<b>--David A. Hollinger, author of <i>After Cloven Tongues of Fire: Protestant Liberalism in Modern American History</i></b></p><p>"One shouldn't use the word &#x2018;masterpiece' promiscuously, but this is a truly valuable excavation and explanation of a puzzling phase of twentieth-century culture that has been not only buried but largely forgotten. Mark Greif's writing is utterly straightforward, and the book is limpidly researched, smartly argued, and, in case after case, stunningly right, as it sheds new light on the crucial middle decades of the century. I was riveted from start to finish."<b>--Morris Dickstein, author of <i>Dancing in the Dark: A Cultural History of the Great Depression</i></b></p><p>"This excellent book offers an original view of midcentury U.S. intellectual and literary history, making a compelling case for a forgotten but pivotal episode: the debate about the 'crisis of man.' Mark Greif elegantly shows how this debate came to shape postwar politics and fiction. His discussions of Hemingway, Faulkner, Bellow, Ellison, O'Connor, and Pynchon are brilliantly illuminating."<b>--Sean McCann, Wesleyan University</b></p><b>Mark Greif</b> is associate professor of literary studies at the New School.

Whether they are narcissistic, unethical, rigid or aggressive, or simply depressed/anxious/burned out, working with them can be a nightmare. Moreover, they can do serious damage to their organizations by diverting energy from productive work, damaging cooperation and knowledge sharing, impairing retention of the best people, weakening morale, and making poor business decisions. In Coping with Toxic Managers, psychiatrist and organizational consultant Dr. Roy Lubit shows you how to develop your emotional intelligence and protect yourself and your organization from the destructive impact of toxic managers. While there are many organizational consultants who utilize psychological insights in their work and psychologists who consult to organizations, Dr. Lubit's depth of training and experience in psychiatry, organizational behavior and organizational consulting provides a basis for unique insights </p></p><p><p>Dr. Roy H. Lubit trained in psychiatry at Yale, wrote a Ph.D. dissertation on organizational learning at Harvard, researched organizational behavior at Columbia Business School, and taught organizational behavior at the City University of New York's Zicklin School of Business. He is a senior consultant to the Center for Social and Emotional Education and a member of the Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations.</p> <p>His professional training and extensive experience in both psychotherapy and organizational dynamics are very unusual. Many people are trained in one of these areas and do some work in the other. Deep involvement in both provides a foundation for unique insights.</p> <p>Dr. Lubit coaches executives; runs leadership workshops; consults to corporations, governmental agencies, and law firms on a variety of organizational issues; and conducts research on fostering emotional intelligence. Dr. Lubit has appeared widely on TV and radio and presented numerous times at professional conferences.</p><p>This book is written for</p> <ul> <li>People who must deal with narcissistic, unethical, aggressive, rigid, depressed, or anxious individuals and want to know how to more effectively manage the situation.</li> <li>Senior managers and human resource professionals who are concerned about toxic managerial behavior in their organization.</li> <li>Those who want to enhance their interpersonal skills and advance their career.</li> </ul> <p>Toxic managers dot the landscape in most organizations making them feel, at times, like war zones. These managers can complicate your work, drain your energy, compromise your sanity and destroy your career. You may not yet have been subjected to aggressive, manipulative, unethical, rigid, or narcissistic behavior by bosses or subordinates. If so, count yourself lucky. In time, however, you will almost certainly experience such behavior.</p> <p>Your ability to deal with difficult managers will have a significant impact on your career. The knowledge you gain from reading this book will help you to deal with them and to avoid letting them derail your projects and your career. This book will help you learn how to recognize toxic managers sooner so that you will be better able to protect yourself. You will develop your understanding of what makes them tick so that you can more effectively design a course of action to deal with their destructive behavior. Some managers are toxic because they are clueless about their effect on others; some are toxic because they do not care if they hurt others; some are toxic because they enjoy hurting others; and some are toxic because they are simply overwhelmed with stress. You will learn how to avoid becoming a scapegoat, how to survive aggressive managers' assaults, and how to give narcissistic and rigid managers the things they need to be satisfied with you. This book can also help you to recognize toxic behavior in yourself, to realize its impact on others, and to contain it.</p> <p>First and foremost, this book is designed to increase the emotional intelligence of the reader. By helping the reader to understand different types of difficult personalities and suggesting ways to more effectively deal with them, it will improve the reader's social competence. For those who are brave enough to recognize difficult behavior in themselves, it will increase their personal competence as well.</p> <p>The last chapter provides a toolkit for developing your emotional intelligence, shielding yourself from some of the pain toxic managers generally cause, and for senior management and human resources to better protect their organization from the destructive impact of toxic managers.</p> <p>This book is designed to be easy to understand. No prior knowledge of psychology is needed. It provides concrete, easy-to-follow solutions to ameliorate the impact of toxic behavior. It also provides a sophisticated understanding of why people behave in destructive ways. Understanding the motivations for toxic behavior is not a sidelight. The basic premise of the book is that understanding the different types of toxic managers and the different motivations that can drive a certain type of toxic behavior is crucial to selecting an effective way to cope.</p> <p>The stories in this book are, unfortunately, true. The names and identifying details have been changed to protect the guilty as well as the innocent. These are events I witnessed or was told about by those who experienced them. I did not use examples from my work as a therapist and executive coach.</p> <p><b>For Senior Managers, HR, and Professionals</b></p> <p>This book will be of interest to senior management and human resources as well as to those with a difficult superior. It is built on an understanding of organizational dynamics and the business environment. It discusses how rigid, unethical, and aggressive behaviors affect productivity and retention and explores what HR and senior management can do to contain this behavior in their organization. In addition, by helping the reader to understand different personality types it enables managers to more effectively motivate, persuade, and develop all of the individuals they work with. The more you can tailor your management style to each individual, the more success both you and those who report to you will have.</p> <p>Many researchers on organizational productivity and success have argued that the key to success lies not in having the perfect strategy, nor in being in the right industry, nor in having an ideal change management plan, nor in charismatic leadership. Rather, the key to success is growing your human resources. Jim Collins writes in Good to Great: "We expected to find that good-to-great leaders would begin by setting a new vision and strategy. We found instead that they first got the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and then the right people in the right seats&#x2014;and then they figured out where to drive it." Charles O'Reilly and Jeffrey Pfeffer in Hidden Value discuss how companies have gotten extraordinary results out of ordinary people and how this is the key to success in today's economy.</p> <p>These researchers focus attention on the crucial role of leadership concentrating on the organization's values and culture. These are very important. But, there is another crucial part of the equation that is less talked about: dealing with the toxic managers who damage the productivity of those under them and above them. Toxic managers interfere with the development of social capital and with the ability and desire of people to trust each other and to be willing to go out of their way for each other. Social capital is very important in improving productivity. In addition to motivating and guiding workers through a strong culture, companies need to remove the obstacles to their performance by decreasing the toxic behavior they face and improving their skills to deal with difficult bosses. Intensive efforts in this area are as yet an unexplored but potentially fruitful area for organizational improvement. It holds tremendous potential for unlocking blocked productivity and for improving the company's ability to hire and retain the best people. Working on the company's culture is an important lever in improving how people treat each other. It is not, however, the only lever. The book discusses many different levers to building organizations in which people can grow and give their best.</p> <p><b>Outline of this Book</b></p> <p>This book is divided into five parts:</p> <ul> <li>Part I&#x2014;Narcissistic managers</li> <li>Part II&#x2014;Unethical Managers</li> <li>Part III&#x2014;Aggressive Managers</li> <li>Part IV&#x2014;Rigid Managers</li> <li>Part V&#x2014;Impaired Managers</li> <li>Part VI&#x2014;Developing and Harnessing Emotional Intelligence</li> </ul> <p>Each part begins with an introduction to the general issues covered in the section: narcissism, unethical behavior, aggression, rigidity, and impairment. The introductions also begin the explanation of the differences between the types of managers discussed in that part so that you can quickly go to the type of manager you are having difficulty with and read that chapter in detail. Differentiating between different types of toxic managers is crucial, since interventions that work with one type of rigid or aggressive manager would backfire with another even though their behavior is similar on the surface. Chapters on the different types of toxic managers begin with a discussion of how those managers behave and what drives their behavior. Detailed examples of such managers follow. The chapters then move on to discuss ways to cope with toxic managers above you and below you. The end of each chapter, and several of the special chapters, discuss how senior management and human resources can recognize potentially toxic managers early in their career, help toxic managers to contain their problematic behavior, place them so that they will not adversely affect the organization, and determine when to get rid of them.</p></p><h2>His Last Bow (Sherlock Holmes)</h2><p>Dr Watson once again opens his portfolio to reveal eight strange cases solved by the keen intellect of the master detective.

His painful formative days at Exeter, where he was sent like a naive lamb to a high WASP academic slaughter, are followed by a poetic self-liberation of sorts at Harvard. Here he rubs elbows with Frank O&#x2019;Hara, John Ashbery, and Edward Gorey, and begins lifelong friendships with Robert Bly, Adrienne Rich, and George Plimpton. After Harvard, Hall is off to Oxford, where the high spirits and rampant poetry careerism of the postwar university scene are brilliantly captured.<br> At eighty, Hall is as painstakingly honest about his failures and low points as a poet, writer, lover, and father as he is about his successes, making Unpacking the Boxes &#x2014; his first book since being named poet laureate &#x2014; both revelatory and tremendously poignant.<br></p><p><p>DONALD HALL (1928-2018) served as poet laureate of the United States from 2006 to 2007. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and a recipient of the National Medal of the Arts, awarded by the president.</p>Domains<p></p><p></p>At fourteen I decided to spend my life writing poetry, which is what I have done. My parents supported my desire, or at least did not attempt to dissuade me. My father hated his work, and it was his passion that I should do what I wanted to do. My mother was prevented by her gender and her era (born 1903) from exercising her intense aimless ambition, which settled on me. They worried how I would make a living at poetry, but would not pressure me to join the prosperous family business, the Brock-Hall Dairy in Connecticut, where my father added columns of figures from Monday into Saturday. Their support was affectionate, _passive, and generous. Beginning when I was a freshman in high school, they gave me for Christmas and birthdays the many books of poetry I listed for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did I come to poetry at such an age? A few years ago in Nebraska, talking about my beginnings to high school students, I told about wanting to write because I loved Poe and Keats, later Eliot and Yeats. A skeptical boy asked, "Didn't you do it to pick up chicks?" "Yes!" I answered. "How could I forget?" In the absence of athletic skill, I found that poetry attracted at least the arty girls if not the cheerleaders. Ambition exists to provide avenue for the libido. This notion begets another, less flattering to the peacock male ego: Maybe all women are the one woman, and everything gets done to woo Mom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother died at ninety, in 1994, while my wife Jane Kenyon was sick. I emptied my mother's house, and a moving van left seventy or eighty boxes at our house and at a cottage we owned down the road. For a long time I could not open them. Three years after Jane died my assistant Kendel Currier moved into the cottage and helped me unpack the boxes. Most of the books would go to the library at the University of New Hampshire. From other boxes my childhood rose like a smoke of moths: a 78 of Connee Boswell singing "The Kerry Dance"; all the letters I ever wrote my father and mother; photographs of my young parents on the boardwalk at Atlantic City; my father's colorless Kodachromes of Long Island Sound; snapshots of cats dead for fifty years; model airplanes and toy cars and a Boy Scout manual, a baseball, and a baseball glove with its oiled pocket chewed by mice. I felt the shock and exultation of exhumation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For weeks I unpacked the boxes, releasing the beginning decades of a life that was concluding its seventh: There were reams of manuscript, a thousand poems, novels I wrote at seventeen and nineteen; high school magazines with my poems and stories&#x2014;the antique tracks of poetry and ambition. I found a high school theme called "The Wild Heifers." I found a verse play called <i>The Folly of Existence.</i> The unpacked boxes laid out my childhood and adolescence as if they assembled a model train, Lionel Standard Gauge, complete with a miniature village set beside the tracks, a hill for the train to tunnel through, a semaphore, mirror glass for a pond. I recollected earliest childhood, seeing a solemn child, three years old. He looks lonely, discontent, bored. At the height of summer he stands, wearing shorts with socks sliding down ankles over indistinct shoes, holding an indistinct toy beside a gray clapboard house, in heat and dust, under a sun that will not relent. The image resembles a black-and-white photograph, but I don't believe it's a remembered snapshot. In family photographs Donnie is spiffed up with his hair combed and water-slicked, his arms stiff at his sides. Donnie was spiffed up and photographed many times: not merely an only child but an only grandchild. Perhaps I was discontent as the focus of the family lens, standing under a sun of singular attention and expectation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In childhood nothing happened. Born in 1928 as Mickey Mouse was&#x2014;Thomas Hardy died that year&#x2014;I breathed the air of the Great Depression. Men stood on street corners selling apples and pencils; tramps came to the back door&#x2014;but my father had a secure job. My mother and father had married on September 10, 1927, and rented the second floor of a house on Coram Street near Lake Whitney in a neighborhood of Hamden, Connecticut, that developers called Spring Glen. Although my mother had been told that she was unlikely to bear a child, I was born a year and ten days after the wedding. When I was one, my parents moved, renting a small house two miles away in another part of Hamden called Whitneyville, originally the site of housing that Eli Whitney made for workers at his gun factory. (A dam at the end of Lake Whitney supplied waterpower.) By the time my father was born, in 1903, near Whitney Avenue, Whitney's village was becoming a New Haven suburb, and soon a trolley line ran four miles to the city's green. The family business thrived a few blocks from our Winette Street house. The Brock-Hall Dairy's horses and wagons delivered milk seven days a week to the back doors of New Haven and its suburbs. Hamden was my father's place, far from my mother's rural New Hampshire. Sometimes my grandmother Kate visited from the farm, a day's journey by train. My grandfather Wesley came rarely; he needed to stay home and tend to the animals. The generations were close in age: My parents were twenty-five when I was born, and Kate was only twenty-five years older.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing happened. Some stories of childhood are tales that grown-ups repeated. I must have been three when I pulled the carrot, and my mother told everyone what Donnie did. She kept a vegetable garden at the bottom of the back yard, and every night before supper she took me with her to pull a fresh carrot for my supper. One evening I walked into the kitchen, a little early, holding my carrot of exemplary intelligence. Memory is stronger when it recalls transgression. I played with a neighbor boy while a repairman worked on the kitchen refrigerator, which had a white coil at its top. The repairman's dented Model T, cut down to a pickup, stood beside the kitchen door on two narrow strips of breaking-apart cement. My playmate and I lifted chunks of concrete onto the pickup's bed. My mother, peeking out the screen door, issued a reprimand, and my friend and I set to undo the crime. I stood in the truck bed lifting chunks down to my accomplice, who wore an Indian headdress. I stood above the boy looking down on his head surrounded by feathers, and carefully dropped a large lump of concrete onto his skull. Oh, the bliss of targeting a head circled by feathers! He howled and ran home; I was sent to my room. Nothing happened. I was small when I wandered a block or two up Augur Street, and sideways into one of the short blocks that paralleled Winette, with no notion of how to get home. Desolation. A tender deliveryman in a red truck returned me to my distraught mother. When I was four I saw my first nude female body. The three-year-old daughter of friends of my parents, who also lived on Winette, came dashing naked out of her house as I walked up the street. I remember my wicked joy as I watched a flustered grandmother run from the house and grab Molly back into privacy. License and rapture began with this vision. My father's parents lived nearby. After a blizzard, my grandfather Henry Hall, who loved horses, had his picture in the <i>New Haven Register </i>because he saddled up and delivered Brock-Hall milk to customers with babies. (He kept a saddle horse with the milk-truck workhorses in the dairy's long stable.) Yet, Henry and Augusta were frightening figures to me&#x2014;because they were frightening to my parents. Their house was always dark; it felt like held breath. When we visited them, often on Sundays, I picked up my parents' anxiety. Would my mother be mocked for her New Hampshire accent? Would my father be found wanting, and be chewed by his father's sarcasm? My father was first child of Henry the self-made man, known at the dairy as H.F., who left school after fifth grade and by hard, honest work built up a business. My father was raised to understand that he could never do anything right, and when he died at fifty-two still labored in vain for his father's approval. On the other hand, my mother grew up eldest of three girls&#x2014;she was forever the older sister; even in her eighties she was older sister to the universe&#x2014;on a farm in rural New Hampshire, oil lamps and church Sundays and an outhouse with five graduated holes. Brought together by the chance of college, in their backgrounds my parents were diverse. Hamden was alien in its gentility and sophistication, and my mother felt intimidated by the manners and mores of Whitneyville and Spring Glen. If she pronounced "Coca-Cola" as "Coker-Coaler," she was teased. Her mother-in-law Augusta had the habit, at our house, of trailing a white-gloved finger across the ledge invisible on top of a doorjamb, then displaying a digit of dust. Doubtless Augusta, daughter of unschooled German immigrants, had needed to establish her own credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, my mother tried to do everything as it should be done. She embraced Hamden's suburban culture with the appearance of enthusiasm. When she rode the trolley into New Haven, to shop at Malley's or Shartenberg's, she wore a hat, a veil, and gloves. My father earned thirty-five dollars a week, yet they spent five of the dollars to hire a full-time maid. Aggie (for Agnes) O'Brien, ten years younger than my parents, was not servile. She sat at the kitchen table with my mother, smoking cigarettes and chatting. I loved Aggie and cuddled with her, listening to her favorite radio programs. She agreed to wait, to marry me when I caught up with her. When my mother felt required to put Aggie in a black dress and black stockings with a white apron, like the French maid in the play, Aggie turned sullen. My mother costumed Aggie when she invited three women friends for bridge in the afternoon. I peeked as the women arrived, one with a fur piece, all lipsticked and powdered, smelling of perfume, three wives in their late twenties or early thirties, wearing dresses and girdles, wearing silk stockings and fancy shoes, wearing hats with veils: tea, cookies, and cakes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although my mother struggled to conform to Hamden, she returned as often as she could to the New Hampshire farm where she grew up, and to my maternal grandparents. Before I started school, she took me with her by train, and quickly I came to love the farm more than I loved Hamden's blocks of six-room houses. Preferring the one place to the other was choosing my mother over my father. A suburban child, I was all the more Connecticut in preferring rural New Hampshire. (Real New Hampshirites don't prefer the state; they are it.) My conflict of geographies&#x2014;two parents, two cultures&#x2014;shaped the devices and desires of my heart. It wasn't until I was fifty, and had moved to the empty maternal New Hampshire farmhouse for good, that I understood how assiduously my mother had determined my preference. Upstairs, Kate kept a fold-down desk of treasures, and there I found my mother's penny postcard, forty-eight years earlier addressed to Kate and Wesley from Connecticut. My mother wrote after she and I had returned to Hamden from a visit: "Donnie's been shouting 'Gale, Gale'" &#x2014; which was the name of the Boston and Maine depot a mile from the farm &#x2014; "and then saying 'Oh, there's Grampa.' He plays 'Go to New Hampshire on the choo-choo train.'"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kate Wells was a fierce conservative of family, farm, and church. Nothing in this house was thrown away; everything connected to the departed was preserved and cherished. Kate had been the beloved youngest child of Ben and Lucy Keneston, born when her father was fifty-two. She loved them back, and would never part with their detritus. The family's history is preserved in this house&#x2014;in mothholed sweaters, fragile quilts, broken chairs, mildewed books&#x2014;like Lenin in his tomb. Kate lamented that her eldest daughter had settled so far away, as I might complain if my son relocated with the grandchildren to Ulan Bator. My mother Lucy felt mildly treacherous because she had abandoned her family, even as she tried to adapt to Hamden: Automobiles, cigarettes, Scotch whiskey, bridge, and restaurants were none of them available or acceptable back home. As a propitiatory donation she gave my soul to New Hampshire, to house and landscape, family and culture. My grandparents accepted the gift, and my grandmother continued to cherish it into her nineties. I spent most of my young summers on the farm, in love with my grandparents and the disappearing countryside. I wrote my first prose book about these summers, <i>String Too Short to Be Saved.</i> I married; I provided Kate two great-grandchildren. When I lived and taught in Michigan, I returned every summer for a few days to the farm and the old woman who still kept sheep. In her nineties she asked me if, when I was far away and spoke of this place, I called it "home."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Connecticut we visited New Hampshire off and on all year. Just before Christmas and in August, my father drove the family to the farm in the Studebaker. Otherwise, my mother and I took the train, climbing into the great steel cars that puffed steam at the New Haven station, sitting at a window on the right side of the aisle to look out on seagulls and oyster flats during our journey. The long links of our train aimed for the hive of enormous South Station in Boston, hub of the Hub. A man came through the car hawking magazines, cigarettes, chewing gum, candy, and cheese sandwiches. We were already provisioned. My mother opened the shoebox before New London, Connecticut&#x2014;exposing a chest (ingots and gold coins) of half sandwiches on decrusted soft bread, each in its own waxed-paper jacket: cream cheese and pineapple, egg salad, chopped ham and pickle; also a stuffed deviled egg; also a frosted cupcake. The New York, New Haven, and Hartford slid past the Connecticut shore, up along Rhode Island to Boston, where we alighted to take a taxi to North Station. The yellow cab beeped through Boston traffic. The station pointing north was smaller, less busy, not so shiny as South Station. From here we set out on our journey backward in time. The locomotive was old, the cars rickety, cloth seat covers ripped and sewed together. The train journeyed through suburbs for half an hour, then reached open country. I looked from my window seat at herds of Holsteins grazing in pastures among the shut-down mill towns (shoes, textiles) north of Boston. The conductor called out "Lowell," "Lawrence," "Nashua," "Manchester" at the brick stops between farmlands. The conductor was old, with a bright red face and a white handkerchief tucked between his neckskin and his loose collar. When he called out "Concord"&nbsp;&#x2014; "Con-CUD" &#x2014; we were coming close. "Boscawen" was pronounced "Bahs-COIN." (For years I assumed it an Indian word but it is Cornish, the name of an English admiral who fought in the French and Indian War. The resolution of that war opened this part of New Hampshire to settlement from Massachusetts.) "Frank-LIN." (Ben Franklin wasn't born there but Daniel Webster was, and it was to Franklin that my mother and her sisters journeyed by train to high school, as their mother had done before them.) "Halcyon" was the depot at East Andover, followed by the town of A...</p><h2>Pippi Longstocking</h2><p>Pippi Longstocking is nine years old. She has just moved into Villa Villekulla where she lives all by herself with a horse, a monkey, and a big suitcase full of gold coins. The grown-ups in the village try to make Pippi behave in ways that they think a little girl should, but Pippi has other<br>ideas. She would much rather spend her days arranging wild, exciting adventures to enjoy with her neighbours, Tommy and Annika, or entertaining everyone she meets with her outrageous stories. Pippi thinks nothing of wrestling a circus strongman, dancing a polka with burglars, or tugging a bull's<br>tail.<br><br>Generations of children have fallen in love with Pippi Longstocking.

After John Wilkes Booth fired a low-velocity .44 caliber bullet into the back of the president's skull, Lincoln did not perish immediately. Attending doctors cleaned and probed the wound, and actually improved his breathing for a time. Today medical trauma teams help similar victims survive-including Gabby Giffords, whose injury was strikingly like Lincoln's. In Diagnosing Giants, Dr. Philip A. Mackowiak examines the historical record in detail, reconstructing Lincoln's last hours moment by moment to calculate the odds. That leads him to more questions: What if he had lived? What sort of neurological function would he have had? What kind of a Constitutional crisis would have ensued? <br><br>Dr. Mackowiak, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, offers a gripping and authoritative account of thirteen patients who took center stage in world history. The result is a new understanding of how the past unfolded, as well as a sweeping survey of the history of medicine. What was the ailment that drove Caligula mad? Why did Stonewall Jackson die after having an arm amputated, when so many other Civil War soldiers survived such operations? As with Lincoln, the author explores the full contest of his subjects' lives and the impact of each case on the course of history, from Tutankhamen, Buddha, and John Paul Jones to Darwin, Lenin, and Eleanor Roosevelt. <br> <br>When an author illuminates the past with state-of-the-art scientific knowledge, readers pay attention. Candice Millard's Destiny of the Republic, about the medical malpractice that killed President James A. Garfield, was a New York Times bestseller. And Dr. Mackowiak's previous book, Post-Mortem: Solving History's Greatest Medical Mysteries, won the attention of periodicals as diverse as the Wall Street Journal and New England Journal of Medicine, which pleaded for a sequel.

At a time when numerous disciplines, organizations, and communities are discovering ethnography, Agar shows how the fundamentals endure even as they adapt to a world unimagined when the research perspective developed more than 100 years ago. Contemporary discussions of ethnography are loaded with choices, primarily &#34;either-or&#34; options. Just as the first edition crossed the qualitative-quantitative divide, the new edition integrates classical scientific notions with new concepts such as narrative and interpretation. Agar updates the contrast between the researcher&#39;s apprenticeship to knowledgeable informants and the hypothesis-testing mode that still dominates social science, while demonstrating the complementarity of the two. Drawing extensively from his own research experience, he illustrates the stages of the ethnographic process from inception through the emergence of a focus, and toward a subsequent formalization of methods and analysis. In the process, he illustrates several approaches designed to reconcile the contradictory demands of the scientific process and human behavior. It analyses the changes in ethnographic studies during the last fifteen years. It outlines the conflict between science and interpretation. It presents the politics of ethnography, both personal and global. It describes the &#39;new&#39; participant observation. It sheds light on ethno-logic. It includes methods for the non-positive.</p><p><b>Michael H. Agar</b> received his Ph.D. in anthropology at the Language-Behavior Research Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley.

How does it hunt living prey, respond to lights, sounds, and smells, and display complex sequences of movements without the benefit of a nervous system? This book offers a startling and original answer.</p><p>In clear, jargon-free language, Dennis Bray taps the findings of the new discipline of systems biology to show that the internal chemistry of living cells is a form of computation. Cells are built out of molecular circuits that perform logical operations, as electronic devices do, but with unique properties. Bray argues that the computational juice of cells provides the basis of all the distinctive properties of living systems: it allows organisms to embody in their internal structure an image of the world, and this accounts for their adaptability, responsiveness, and intelligence.</p><p>In <i>Wetware</i>, Bray offers imaginative, wide-ranging and perceptive critiques of robotics and complexity theory, as well as many entertaining and telling anecdotes.

James Holland, one of the leading young historians of World War II, has spent over a decade conducting new research, interviewing survivors, and exploring archives that have never before been so accessible to unearth forgotten memoirs, letters, and official records. In <i>The Rise of Germany</i>, Holland draws on this research to reconsider the strategy, tactics, and economic, political, and social aspects of the war. <i>The Rise of Germany</i> is a masterful book that redefines our understanding of the opening years of World War II. Beginning with the lead-up to the outbreak of war in 1939 and ending in the middle of 1941 on the eve of Operation Barbarossa, the Nazi invasion of Russia, <i>The Rise of Germany</i> is a landmark history of the war on land, in the air, and at sea.</p><p><b>James Holland</b> is a member of the British Commission for Military History and the Guild of Battlefield Guides.

He examines the structure of the Mass both before and after the Second Vatican Council, offering a brief overview of the history and development of liturgical music from the 8th century Carolingian Renaissance to the contemporary implementation of the reforms of the Second Vatican Council. Concluding with a thoughtful analysis of the current state of liturgical music, Deacon Schaefer provides a variety of musical examples which are easily accessed online or via the downloadable ebook. &#34;As for the music of the Catholic Church, its story is one that touches most aspects of the Church s life: her public worship, her piety, her morality, her teaching, her politics, and her struggle to fulfill Christ s mission, that is, to use earthly tools to accomplish a heavenly command...Indeed, the story of the Church s music is so intertwined with the story of the Church itself that the two cannot be fully separated without injustice to one or the other.

Now Jerry Brotton deftly captures this remarkable age, in a book that places Europe's great flowering in a revealing global context. <br> It was Europe's contact with the outside world, Brotton argues, especially with the rich and cultivated East, that made the Renaissance what it was. Indeed, Europeans saw themselves through the mirror of the East--it was during this age, for instance, that they first spoke of themselves as "Europeans." Here is cultural history of the best kind, as Brotton muses on the meanings of Holbein's painting "The Ambassadors"--which is virtually a catalog of the international influences on Europe--or on the Arabic influence in the burgeoning sciences of astronomy and geography. This global approach offers revealing new insights into such men as Dante and Leonardo da Vinci and highlights the international influences behind Chaucer's <em>Canterbury Tales</em>. Along with fresh and original discussions of well-known figures from Copernicus to D�rer to Shakespeare, Brotton offers a far-reaching exploration that looks at paintings and technology, patterns of trade and the printed page, as he illuminates the overarching themes that defined the age.<br> From architecture to medicine, from humorists to explorers, the teeming world of the Renaissance comes to life in this thoughtful, insightful, and beautifully written book, which offers us a timely perspective on the Renaissance as a moment of global inclusiveness that still has much to teach us today.</p><p><br><strong>Jerry Brotton</strong> is a Lecturer in English at the University of London. He is the author of <em>Trading Territories: Mapping the Early Modern World</em> and <em>Global Interests: Renaissance Art between East and West</em> (with Lisa Jardine).<br>Despite what most of us learned in high school, this scholarly yet accessible book argues that the storied achievements of the Renaissance did not rest solely on the chiseled shoulders of a few Italian men. Instead, posits Brotton, a lecturer at the University of London, the cultivated East had a profound impact on the West during the famously fertile period of 1400-1600. With broad brushstrokes, Brotton applies his thesis to major Renaissance innovations, revealing the Islamic world's contributions to fields as varied as cartography, astronomy, architecture and commerce. Not only did Iberian forays into Southeast Asia and Africa boost Western appetites for "conspicuous consumption" in the forms of spices and frippery, they also heightened Europe's awareness of her own status relative to her wealthy distant neighbors, the Ottoman Empire. Brotton goes north as well, singling out German and Flemish paintings as iconic representations of this East-West exchange. But in his plea for inclusion, he jeopardizes his own coverage: this lean volume suffers from an excess of overview and an absence of focus, which may disappoint, as might his cursory consideration of the regrettable consequences of this meeting of worlds-colonization, and the rise of the slave trade. 25 halftones &amp; 8 color plates <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>I&#39;m the Man: The Story of That Guy from Anthrax</h2><p><i>I'm the Man</i> is the fast&#x2013;paced, humorous, and revealing memoir from the man who co-founded Anthrax, the band that proved to the masses that brutality and fun didn't have to be mutually exclusive. Through various lineup shifts, label snafus, rock 'n' roll mayhem, and unforeseen circumstances galore, Scott Ian has approached life and music with a smile, viewing the band with deadly seriousness while recognizing the ridiculousness of the entertainment industry. Always performing with abundant energy that revealed his passion for his craft, Ian has never let the gravity of being a rock star go to his shaven, goateed head.<br><br>Ian tells his life story with a clear-eyed honesty that spares no one, least of all himself, starting with his upbringing as a nerdy Jewish boy in Queens and evolving through his first musical epiphany when he saw KISS live on television and realized what he wanted to do with his life. He chronicles his adolescence growing up in a dysfunctional home where the records blasting on his stereo failed to drown out the sound of his parents shouting at one another. He sets down the details of his fateful escape into the turbulent world of heavy metal. And of course he lays bare the complete history of Anthrax&#x2014;from the band's formation to their present-day reinvigoration&#x2014;as they wrote and recorded thrash classics like <i>Spreading the Disease</i>, <i>Among the Living</i>, and the top-twenty-charting <i>State of Euphoria</i>.<br><br>Along the way, Ian recounts harrowing, hysterical tales from his long tour of duty in the world of hard rock. He witnesses the rise of Metallica, for which he had a front row seat. He parties with the late Dimebag Darrell while touring with Pantera and gets wild with Black Label Society frontman and longtime Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Zakk Wylde. He escapes detection while interviewing Ozzy for "The Rock Show" while dressed as Gene Simmons and avoids arrest after getting detained on suspicion of drugs while riding the tube in England with the late Metallica bassist Cliff Burton.<br><br>In addition, <i>I'm the Man</i> addresses the trials and tribulations of Ian's life and loves. He admits his foibles and reveals the mistakes made along the way to becoming a fully-functioning adult. He celebrates finally finding peace and a true sense of family with his wife, singer/songwriter Pearl Aday, and examines how his world changed after the birth of their first son.<br><br><i>I'm the Man</i> is a blistering hard rock memoir, one that is astonishing in its candor and deftly told by the man who's kept the institution of Anthrax alive for more than thirty years.<br></p><p><b>Scott Ian</b> is co-founder, guitarist, and chief lyricist of Anthrax and Stormtroopers of Death. He is a Yankees fan and lives with his wife and son outside Los Angeles, California.<br><br><b>Jon Wiederhorn</b> is co-author of <i>Louder Than Hell: The Definitive Oral History of Metal</i> and <i>Ministry: The Lost Gospels According to Al Jourgensen</i>. He is a senior writer at <i>Revolver</i> and a contributor to <i>Guitar World</i>, Yahoo.com, eMusic, and Niosey.com. He lives in Brooklyn, New York, with his wife and two children.<br><b><i>Creative Loafing Tampa</i>, 11/7/14</b><br> The book chronicles the intensity of metal's commercial explosion in its heyday. That includes plenty of conflicts within the band and in Ian's personal life, and the book is being touted as a brutally honest confessional along the lines of Andre Agassi's Open.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Dead Rhetoric, 11/9/14</b><br> It's pretty honest stuff, especially when Ian details the band's and his personal life's low-points, which there are several, but hardly of the clich� variety I'm the Man is a killer read.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Glide, 11/18/14</b><br> [Ian] talks straight, never fails to lay blame on himself for certain actions, and comes across as nothing but honest.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Brave Words &amp; Bloody Knuckles, 11/21/14</b><br> Riveting, top notch Far superior to the glut of rock biographies currently available. In addition to the very revealing nature, this is a visual feast as well This book knows no limits, making it impossible to put down Don't hesitate, just buy! Guaranteed, this is an awesome read and would make a fantastic Christmas present.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Rock Pages, December 2014</b><br> A well-crafted autobiography...Da Capo Press has done an outstanding job in inserting various rare photos from Scott Ian's personal archive while it also added an Ian-penned comic with Lemmy being the protagonist.&#x201d;<br><br><br><b><i>Jewish Telegraph</i>, 9/19/14</b><br> Scott writes with real honesty I'm the Man stands up as a great insight into one of metal's leading figures. And you don't have to be a thrash or rock fan to enjoy it.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Cleveland Music Examiner.com, 10/7/14</b><br> Eye-opening The hard-charging head-banger has assembled his best anecdotes into the revealing autobiography For every familiar factoid, Ian introduces two or three new nuggets even diehard Anthrax fans probably didn't know Despite the shenanigans and chicanery of Ian's teens and twenties, the man who emerges here is surprisingly level-headed and articulate.&#x201d;<br><br><b>The Real Rene, 10/14/14</b><br> Scott Ian is such a cool and down to earth guy that you feel he is right there with you telling you all these stories. This is not a book about drugs or groupies (well maybe some) but rather a compelling story about one of the coolest guys in rock n roll history.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>San Antonio Express-News</i>, 10/26/14</b><br> A quick, entertaining read that's often laugh-out-loud funny. Scott Ian is a natural storyteller and he offers a clear-eyed, ground-level view of the harder edge of metal that Anthrax helped pioneer.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Media Mikes, 10/20/14</b><br> <i>I'm the Man</i> is much more than a collection of road stories as Ian delves deep in to his personal experience with love, life and all things Dimebag Darrell Over the book's 316 pages Ian is candid and unabashed A solid read For newer fans and for those who have followed Scott Not' Ian from the early days this book is for you.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Stereo Embers, 10/13/14</b><br> I'm the Man isn't a typical rock star autobiography. Although it has its share of hilarious stories of drugs and partying, the book refreshingly focuses on the guiding light of Scott's life: music and, in particular, the music of Anthrax The book is a thrilling ride through the ups and downs of being in a rock and roll band Moreover, I'm the Man will give you a greater understanding of how the Big 4 thrash bands Anthrax, Megadeth, Slayer, and Metallica somehow managed to change the course of heavy music, steering it away from the hair metal of the 1980s through sheer hard work, will, and perseverance Scott Ian really is the man and you'd do yourself a disservice by not reading his thrilling autobiography.&#x201d;<br><br><b>This Is Book's Music, 10/18/14</b><br> You might read the book thinking it will be nothing but inside stuff about the band and the recording industry, and it does touch on all of this quite well. It also has Ian looking at the world from a personal perspective, to show how he loves his music but is also someone with a mind and a sense of humor.&#x201d;<br><br><b>NoEcho.net, 10/13/14</b><br> One of the most outspoken and ubiquitous figures in the heavy metal community, it was inevitable that Ian would someday write an autobiography The guitarist is a gifted storyteller, conveying each memory with an enthralling balance of humor, wit, and self-awareness Along with Metallica, Slayer, and Megadeth, Anthrax are part of the "Big 4," and Ian offers up the kind of insider stories behind all the groups that trivia hounds will eat up It doesn't matter if you're a devout Anthrax follower, or just a casual fan of the group, I'm the Man is a fun read, packed with juicy stories from Ian's colorful career on and off stage Just like the song it was named after, I'm the Man is irreverent, hilarious, and, at times, aggressive.&#x201d;\<br><br><b>LithiumMagazine.com, 10/14/14</b><br> Scott Ian has, in his many decades as a touring musician, shared the stage with pretty much everyone who is anyone in hard rock and heavy metal. And he seems to have a photographic memory, as his power of recall has the uncanny ability to virtually bring the reader into the room with him I'm The Man will please Anthrax fans. It will also please music fans who maybe don't know so much about Anthrax. The passion behind his band, perseverance over numerous hardships, and the ability to recount tales gone by with an often humorous stilt makes for an entertaining read.&#x201d;\<br><br><b>John Shelton Ivany Top 21, Issue 445</b><br> Ian tells his life story with a clear-eyed honesty that spares no one, least of all himself.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Oakland Press</i>, 12/19/14</b><br> If you've attended or heard any of Ian's spoken-word performances you know he's a natural raconteur, and that also comes through in this book, a memoir that's enriched by Ian's eye for smaller details that can be built into unexpected, captivating complements to the larger story he's telling.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Examiner.com, 12/24/14</b><br> Not just a chronicle of his band's life and times, the book is also a mix of a coming of age story for Queens' Ian and a look at a historic time in heavy metal This book [sits] comfortably among the best rock biographies to hit the streets in the last few years.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Heavy Metal About.com, 10/13/14</b><br> There aren't a lot of bands where the rhythm guitarist is the most high profile member of the band, but Scott Ian has always been the heart of Anthrax [Ian] isn't afraid to say what's on his mind, and the book reflects his willingness to tell it like it is, even if it sometimes doesn't put him in a very flattering light Ian really knows how to tell a story and the book is extremely compelling. It's a great blend of the events that shaped him and Anthrax, his personal life and crazy and hilarious tales from throughout his life. It's a must-read for any fan of Ian and Anthrax.&#x201d;<br><br><b>HornsUpRocks.com, 10/15/14</b><br> One of the best books you will ever read! It's honest, it's entertaining and full of stories of one of the guys to blame for Heavy Music being what it is today Whither you are a veteran musician or you are just starting out, this is a book you must read and absorb as the amount of knowledge and lessons of perseverance that Scott shares will make you a better musician. Hell, this book will inspire any human being to have big goals and to never stop working in order to accomplish those goals.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Eternal Terror, 10/20/14</b><br> An interesting and inspiring read No stone is left unturned in this book when it comes to Anthrax Ian is brutally honest and tells it like it is A fast-paced, funny, revealing and at times tragic account of how a geeky boy from New York made it in the world of music and just how thin the line between devastating and triumphant really is, not just in the world of music, but in life in general. The book strikes a really nice balance between the uplifting aspects of being in a metal band as well as all the bullshit, backstabbing, setbacks and pain that ensue from it all One need not be a fan of Anthrax, S.O.D. or even The Damned Things in order to enjoy this book. It is so well-written, humorous, heart-warming and even downright insane in places that one cannot avoid being moved by it A captivating and fascinating read. Highly recommended!&#x201d;<br><br><b>My Big Honkin Blog, 10/25/14</b><br> It is [Ian's] average Joe-ness that makes his story of struggle, determination and persistence, told in the new bio, <i>I'm the Man</i>, so interesting You can't help but root for the guy. The fact that he didn't go out of his way to screw things up like so many rockers do also tends to make the story unique This one is a great read whether you're a fan or not.&#x201d;<br><br><b>MediaBistro.com, 11/6/14</b><br> Fast-paced, funny, and revealing.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Revolver</i>, 10/14/14</b><br> [A] compelling memoir Like any good rock bio, I'm the Man abounds with tales of debauchery, fisticuffs, and other insanity on the road The book is also full of revelations All this keeps the pages turning. But I'm the Man is not just a tell-all. It's an inspiring tale of perseverance in the face of endless lineup and label changes, rehearsal room fires, and a fickle music industry and it's also a cautionary tale And Ian pulls no punches many, at himself when discussing how the craziness of the touring life makes normal' life almost impossible I'm the Man proves to be the perfect title for the book, because what ultimately crystallizes is a rounded picture of Ian, not as a metal icon, but as a man: one who tried and sometimes failed but always kept trying, and can look back on it all with honesty and clarity.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Houston Press</i>, 11/5/14</b><br> The book of course tells the complete history of the thrash-metal legends from their hardscrabble beginnings and cult status through the varying lineups, discography and playing huge stadiums with the rest of the Big 4' (Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer). But it's also about how this short Jewish kid from Queens, N.Y. basically got through life with the help of music.&#x201d;<br><br><b>NeuFutur.com, 10/31/14</b><br> The book is just as good as you'd expect a book by Scott Ian would be. Often self-deprecating funny and more than a little revealing, <i>I'm the Man</i> is one of the few books about metal that even those unimpressed by the genre can appreciate <i>I'm the Man</i> manages to be one of those unique rock autobiographies that end up being about much more than rock and being in a band.&#x201d;<br><br><b>BackstageAxxess.com, 10/28/14</b><br> A great first hand account of the history of thrash.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Parade Magazine</i>, 11/16/14</b><br> Scott Ian describes what it's like to go from kid with guitar to thrash-metal pioneer.&#x201d;</p><h2>Trees (Smithsonian&#39;s Natural World Series)</h2><p>More than 80,000 species of trees today cover a full 30 percent of the earth&#39;s land mass and have dominated the earth for over 300 million years.

Master clinician Karen J. Maroda adds an important dimension to the psychodynamic literature by exploring the role of both clients' and therapists' emotional experiences in the process of therapy. The book discusses how to become more attuned to one's own experience of a client; offer direct feedback and self-disclosure in the service of treatment goals; and manage intense feelings and conflict in the relationship. Specific techniques are illustrated with vivid case examples. Maroda clearly distinguishes between therapeutic and nontherapeutic ways to work with emotion in this candid and instructive guide.</p></p><p><p>Karen J. Maroda, PhD, ABPP, is Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the Medical College of Wisconsin and is in private practice in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She is the past ethics chair and a board member of Division 39 (Psychoanalysis) of the American Psychological Association and past president of Division 39's Section III, Women, Gender, and Psychoanalysis. The author of two previous books, <i>The Power of Countertransference</i> and <i>Seduction, Surrender, and Transformation</i>, Dr. Maroda has also published numerous journal articles, book chapters, and book reviews. She lectures nationally and internationally on a variety of aspects of the therapeutic process, including the place of affect, self-disclosure, countertransference, legitimate authority, and the need for clinical guidelines. Dr. Maroda is on the editorial board of two major journals, <i>Psychoanalytic Psychology </i>and the <i>Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Psychotherapy</i>, and is corresponding editor of <i>Contemporary Psychoanalysis</i>; she actively encourages her colleagues to write and talk about what they actually do as therapists.</p>"Maroda clearly describes how the psychotherapist's emotional responses to the patient's communications are essential to the change processes that lie at the core of the therapeutic relationship. Her clinical model for working more deeply in the affective realm is solidly grounded in interpersonal neurobiology. This extraordinary book is filled with practical information and rich case vignettes. I highly recommend it."--Allan N. Schore, PhD, Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles<p>"Maroda's proven skill at highly instructive use of courageous self-disclosure is superbly displayed in this revealing work on that rarest of topics: specific elucidation of technique in dynamic therapy. Full of practical advice and illuminating case material, this book is a godsend for therapists."--Thomas G. Gutheil, MD, Department of Psychiatry, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School</p>"Maroda brings such a wealth of seasoned clinical experience and wisdom to this book that it inevitably will be an invaluable resource. She offers a treatment-oriented presentation that is sophisticated yet lucid and pragmatic."--Edgar A. Levenson, MD, William Alanson White Institute, New York City<br>&nbsp;"Though intended primarily for inexperienced clinicians, this book has much to offer therapists at every level of practice. It is in equal turns scholarly and eminently practical, and imparts the clinical wisdom of a senior therapist who is willing to discuss the intricacies of clinical process with emotional and professional candor. The multidimensional clinical illustrations are evocative and elegantly crafted. Highly recommended."--Jerrold R. Brandell, PhD, Distinguished Professor, Wayne State University School of Social Work; Editor-in-Chief, <i>Psychoanalytic Social Work</i><p></p>"With this engaging, readable book, Maroda answers a long-standing need for a primer on psychodynamic technique. In her characteristic melding of professional and personal experience, theoretical sophistication, research findings, and plain-spoken common sense, Maroda serves up a banquet of good advice that will nourish not only students and beginning therapists, but also experienced practitioners. She keeps the focus on the practical and generously illustrates her points with clinical vignettes that exemplify the emotional honesty she so consistently recommends. I look forward to assigning this welcome text to my graduate students in clinical psychology."--Nancy McWilliams, PhD, ABPP, Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey &nbsp;"This is an outstanding contribution by a master clinician. Maroda takes the reader on an intimate tour of becoming a good psychotherapist. Her generous use of case examples allows the reader to enter into her consulting room, and illustrates the nuances of various dynamic methods. This book should be mandatory reading for graduate students facing the trepidation and uncertainty of immersing oneself in clinical practice."--Jon Mills, PsyD, PhD, ABPP, private practice, Ajax, Ontario, Canada<br><br>"What makes Maroda's work particularly remarkable, however, is that she not only manages to identify and explicate aspects of technique, but that the range of skills she addresses all converge on what can seem like an especially mystifying topic to new clinicians: the use of emotion in the therapeutic relationship. Maroda's pragmatic tone seems to effortlessly weave concrete skills through the particularly vaporous topic if using emotion productively. The result is an admirably unmechanistic set of principles to aid clinicians in navigating the complex emotional terrain of the therapeutic relationship in a manner consistent with their own personal styles. One of the major strengths of Psychodynamic Technique is its breadth, and Maroda provides a good balance, including both general and specific issues related to the role of emotion in the therapeutic process....The annotated bibliography of both theoretical and practical literature is a valuable resource....Maroda's direct, clear, honest language models an approach for which all clinicians should strive. In addition to her own experience as a therapist and supervisor, she draws from a wide range of sources, including recent neuroimaging studies, relevant research on affect and attachment, as well as psychodynamic theory. These multiple perspectives will likely enrich any reader's understanding of even the most well-worn issues of psychodynamic practice....The process of reading the book parallels the process of a successful therapy in which one has come to engage with and trust her guide and emerges a more flexible, confident, insightful person and professional. Maroda's continued reassurances and frank openness to sharing her own vulnerabilities leaves the reader feeling infused with a sense of possibility that a fuller, deeper therapeutic relationship is possible....I finished Psychodynamic Techniques with a feeling of confidence that the tools necessary to work with emotion in the therapeutic relationship are readily available." (<i>Psychotherapy</i> 2012-10-20)<br><br>"Maroda has something worthwhile to share with us regarding the essential ingredients of therapeutic change....This simply and straightforwardly written book is the work of a courageous, emotionally honest, skilled, and wise clinician. It is a book that succeeds beautifully in fulfilling its mission: that emotional resonance or affective emotional communication between client and therapist is critical to the change process and constitutes the essential core of the therapeutic relationship. In the spirit of the phenomenological approach to understanding, this reviewer has remained close to the author's own words&#x2015;words that revealed richly rewarding insights regarding the theme of change, insights that have concrete consequences for the actual practice of psychotherapy....Those of us who are interested in rigorously researching and understanding what therapists actually do inside the consulting room, in general, and, more importantly, how therapy works&#x2015;how the therapeutic change happens, in particular, would do well to mine such outstanding works as Maroda's. By systematically studying such works, which are experience-near and thus incipiently phenomenological, we can gain a greater understanding of the essential ingredients of therapeutic change."

(<i>Division/Review (Publication of APA Division 39)</i> 2012-10-20)<br><br>"The book contains a wealth of practical suggestions for managing emotional interactions with clients, distinguishing between therapeutic and non-therapeutic ways to work with emotion. The shared hopes, fears and expectations of therapist and client are initially discussed, progressing on to the more complex emotional experiences encountered in the developing therapeutic relationship. The author interweaves her own case study experiences into each chapter and explores rarely addressed topics, including identifying and managing regression, implementing self-disclosure and using conflict effectively. This book is a fascinating and valuable resource for new and established therapists. By exploring and applying the guidelines Maroda offers, therapists can create a body of useful psychodynamic techniques for effective therapy."

Her timing is impeccable....Maroda's book is destined to play a crucial role in grounding psychodynamic theory in empirical demonstrability and practical utility, serving as the basis for any thorough-going clinical technique. This book serves as one of the few linchpins that just may resituate psychodynamic theory as the cornerstone of sound clinical theory and technique. Pitched to new trainees, this book offers much to those who teach psychodynamic psychotherapy to the neophyte as well as the more experienced....Maroda illustrates all of the basic principles with honest and explicitly detailed case examples from her own practice. She has an engaging writing style, revealing personal reactions and recalling the felt-sensations when she was a beginning therapist. The 'sweaty palms' and 'queasy stomach' we all experienced is part of her charm; any writer willing to open herself up in this way plants a treasure trove of seasoning throughout. She could not be more generous with explicit examples from her clinical experience, including word for word reproductions of her interventions, thought processes, doubts and feelings....This book is an empirically substantiated, practical guide to the therapeutic landscape. I know a young woman about to enter graduate school in clinical psychology for whom I have already bought this book as a gift to celebrate her budding career.

At the center of his philosophy was a revolutionary model of the way human beings think. Peirce, a logician, challenged traditional models by describing thoughts not as &#34;ideas&#34; but as &#34;signs,&#34; external to the self and without meaning unless interpreted by a subsequent thought. His general theory of signs -- or semiotic -- is especially pertinent to methodologies currently being debated in many disciplines.</p><p>"This edition will be an exemplary way for students and scholars to make a deep acquaintance with Peirce.<p>Bruce Kuklick, University of Pennsylvania"<br><br>This edition will be an exemplary way for students and scholars to make a deep acquaintance with Peirce.</p><p>Bruce Kuklick, University of Pennsylvania</p>James Hoopes, professor of history at Babson College, is author of <i>Consciousness in New England: From Puritanism and Ideas to Psychoanalysis and Semiotic</i>.</p><h2>Yoga and the Quest for the True Self</h2><p>Millions of Americans know yoga as a superb form of exercise and as a potent source of calm in the midst of our stress-filled lives. Far fewer are aware of the full promise of yoga as "the way of the fully alive human being"--a 4,000-year-old practical path of liberation that fits the needs of modern Western seekers with startling precision.<br><br>Now one of America's leading scholars of yoga psychology--who is also a Western-trained psychotherapist--offers this marvelously lively and personal account of an ancient tradition that promises "the soul awake in this lifetime."&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawing on the vivid stories of practitioners at the largest yoga center in America, where he has lived and taught for more than ten years, Stephen Cope describes the philosophy, psychology, and practice of yoga--a practical science of development that urges us not to transcend or dissolve the self, but rather to encounter it more deeply.<br><br>In this irreverent modern-day <b>Pilgrim's Progress</b>, Cope introduces us to an unforgettable cast of contemporary seekers--on the road to enlightenment carrying all the baggage of the human condition: confusion, loss, disappointment, addiction, and the eternal conflicts around sex and relationship. As he describes the subtle shifts of energy and consciousness that happen at each stage of the path, we discover that in yoga, "liberation" does not require us to leave life in the world for some transcendent spiritual plane. Life itself is the path.<br><br>Above all, Cope shows how yoga can heal the suffering of self-estrangement that pervades our society, leading us to a new sense of purpose and to a deeper, more satisfying life in the world.</p><p>Despite skeptical jibes from his well-meaning friends, Stephen Cope set off for a four-month yoga retreat in rural Massachusetts. Ten years later, he is still there. A psychotherapist left in the lurch after a long-term relationship, Cope was experiencing the same deep questioning of life that he had witnessed so often in his practice. His self-prescribed antidote was to pursue a life of contemplation and inner discovery that he had felt drawn to for some time. <i>Yoga and the Quest for the True Self</i> is Cope's chronicle of self-discovery. Cope is at turns frank in describing his own obstacles and epiphanies, brotherly in relating anecdotes of friends and patients on similar quests, and clinical in his trenchant psychological summations of why we find ourselves estranged and how yoga and meditation bring us back to clear awareness. Like Mark Epstein's <i>Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart</i>, <i>Yoga and the Quest for the True Self</i> is a milestone in the melding of Eastern and Western methods of personal transformation. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>"What a delight to find a book on spiritual practice that's as compelling to read as a good novel.

Much of Europe once knew them as "child-devouring cannibals" and "bloodthirsty Huns." But it wasn't long before the Hungarians became steadfast defenders of the Christian West and fought heroic freedom struggles against the Tatars (1241), the Turks (16-18th centuries), and, among others, the Russians (1848-49 and 1956). Paul Lendvai tells the fascinating story of how the Hungarians, despite a string of catastrophes and their linguistic and cultural isolation, have survived as a nation-state for more than 1,000 years.</p><br><p>Lendvai, who fled Hungary in 1957, traces Hungarian politics, culture, economics, and emotions from the Magyars' dramatic entry into the Carpathian Basin in 896 to the brink of the post-Cold War era. Hungarians are ever pondering what being Hungarian means and where they came from. Yet, argues Lendvai, Hungarian national identity is not only about ancestry or language but also an emotional sense of belonging. Hungary's famous poet-patriot, S�ndor Petofi, was of Slovak descent, and Franz Liszt felt deeply Hungarian though he spoke only a few words of Hungarian. Through colorful anecdotes of heroes and traitors, victors and victims, geniuses and imposters, based in part on original archival research, Lendvai conveys the multifaceted interplay, on the grand stage of Hungarian history, of progressivism and economic modernization versus intolerance and narrow-minded nationalism.</p><br><p>He movingly describes the national trauma inflicted by the transfer of the historic Hungarian heartland of Transylvania to Romania under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon in 1920--a trauma that the passing of years has by no means lessened. The horrors of Nazi and Soviet Communist domination were no less appalling, as Lendvai's restrained account makes clear, but are now part of history.</p><br><p>An unforgettable blend of eminent readability, vibrant humor, and meticulous scholarship, <i>The Hungarians</i> is a book without taboos or prejudices that at the same time offers an authoritative key to understanding how and why this isolated corner of Europe produced such a galaxy of great scientists, artists, and entrepreneurs.</p></p><p><p>"This brief narrative of Hungarian history, elegantly translated into English, is written with verve, humor, profound insights, and just the right degree of cynicism. It well explains the dilemma of a respectable old state squeezed between more powerful neighbors, the contradictions between individual genius and repeated national failure, and the recurring tragic conflicts between the defense of nationhood and messianic nationalism. It is supplemented with fascinating essays on, for instance, the complexities of Jewish and German assimilation into the Hungarian nation."<b>--Istv�n De�k, Columbia University</b></p><p>"When Paul Lendvai, the indefatigable observer of Eastern Europe, writes a book, he has in general something exciting to relate. . . . Lendvai's book is a well-constructed mixture of historical facts, political judgments, and cultural anecdotes."<b>--Der Spiegel</b></p><p>"Lendvai has written a standard-setting work, always at the highest level of historical research yet so eminently readable, so entertaining--only a journalist out of passion with profound knowledge of history is able to write in this way. . . .

Sometimes these projects generate unprecedented solutions; sometimes they converge on common goals and realize larger transformations. As Ezio Manzini describes in this book, we are witnessing a wave of social innovations as these changes unfold&#x2015;an expansive open co-design process in which new solutions are suggested and new meanings are created. </p><p>Manzini distinguishes between <i>diffuse design</i> (performed by everybody) and <i>expert design </i>(performed by those who have been trained as designers) and describes how they interact. He maps what design experts can do to trigger and support meaningful social changes, focusing on emerging forms of collaboration. These range from community-supported agriculture in China to digital platforms for medical care in Canada; from interactive storytelling in India to collaborative housing in Milan. These cases illustrate how expert designers can support these collaborations&#x2015;making their existence more probable, their practice easier, their diffusion and their convergence in larger projects more effective. Manzini draws the first comprehensive picture of design for social innovation: the most dynamic field of action for both expert and nonexpert designers in the coming decades. </p></p><p>Ezio Manzini, a leading thinker in design for sustainability, founded DESIS, an international network on design for social innovation and sustainability (http://www.desis-network.org). He is Honorary Professor at the Politecnico di Milano, Chair Professor at University of the Arts London, and currently guest Professor at Tongji University, Shanghai, and Jiangnan University, Wuxi.<p><i>Design, When Everybody Designs</i> by Ezio Manzini is a timely, provocative, and essential read for all those that are engaged in or are affected by design and design processes&#x2015;in other words, all of us. Whether one is an elite designer, a grassroots activist, a design educator, or a bureaucratic or corporate decision maker, Ezio Manzini challenges us all to rethink the role of design and that of the 'designers' in contemporary society. He wants us to reimagine design's relationship to addressing social innovation and building a sustainable and resilient culture. To say it is must-reading is an understatement&#x2013;it is a clarion call for a conversation to be launched to rethink what is normal and what ought to be.</p>&#x2015;<b>Ronald Shiffman</b>, Professor Emeritus, Pratt Institute Programs for Sustainable Planning and Development, Pratt Institute School of Architecture; coauthor of <i>Building Together: Case Studies in Participatory Planning and Community Building</i><br><br><p>In this extraordinary new book, Ezio Manzini challenges us to imagine a future that is more ecologically and socially resilient and more desirable to live in. Through compelling examples of local social innovation around the world today, Manzini shows that it is possible to begin to change the way we think and live, to change how we relate to each other and the world around us, and in the process begin to make the world anew.

The book's relevance is enhanced through the generously illustrated and accessible case studies from diverse sociocultural, economic, and geopolitical contexts. This important text is highly recommended to anyone keen to understand the evolving role of the designer, and how this (r)evolution impacts upon the pedagogic, research, and professional practice imperatives of design in the future.</p>&#x2015;<b>Mugendi K.

It describes a) the fundamental characteristics of electromagnetic radiation and how the energy interacts with Earth materials such as vegetation, water, soil and rock, b) how the energy reflected or emitted from these materials is recorded using a variety of remote sensing instruments (e.g., cameras, multispectral scanners, hyperspectral instruments, RADAR), and c) how we can extract fundamental biophysical or land use/land cover information from the remote sensor data. The history of remote sensing, the principles of visual photo-interpretation, and photogrammetry are also presented. Application chapters focus on remote sensing of vegetation, water, urban land use, and soil/rock and geomorphic features. The book was written for physical, natural, and social scientists interested in how remote sensing of the environment can be used to solve real-world problems. The following features make this book easy to comprehend and apply: a) it contains hundreds of illustrations specially designed to make complex principles easy to understand, b) a substantial reference list at the end of each chapter, c) the 8.5 x 11&#34; format allows the remote sensing images and diagrams to be easily interpreted, d) 32 pages of color are used to display remote sensing images or biophysical information that may be extracted from remote sensor data, and e) an Appendix provides Internet addresses for the most important sources of remote sensing information. Exercises and book illustrations are made available to instructors via the author&#39;s website. This book is a companion to &#34;Introductory Digital Image Processing: A Remote Sensing Perspective&#34; (Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1996) which introduces the fundamentals of digital image analysis. It is ideal for undergraduate or graduate courses in airphoto interpretation and remote sensing.</p><p></p><h2>Collected Stories</h2><p>This magisterial collection of short works by Nobel Prize-winning author William Faulkner reminds readers of his ability to compress his epic vision into narratives as hard and wounding as bullets.

One of the towering figures of American literature, he is the author of <i>The Sound and the Fury</i>, <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i>, and <i>As I Lay Dying</i>, among many other remarkable books. Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1950 and France&#x2019;s Legion of Honor in 1951. He died in 1962.&#x201c;No man ever put more of his heart and soul into the written word than did William Faulkner.

Aligned with no single tradition, they escape straightforward categories. Yet their work evinces an affinity of style and philosophical viewpoint that derives from a shared attitude toward suffering. What Mary McCarthy called a &#x201c;cold eye&#x201d; was not merely a personal aversion to displays of emotion: it was an unsentimental mode of attention that dictated both ethical positions and aesthetic approaches.<br> <br> <i>Tough Enough</i> traces the careers of these women and their challenges to the pre-eminence of empathy as <i>the</i> ethical posture from which to examine pain. Their writing and art reveal an adamant belief that the hurts of the world must be treated concretely, directly, and realistically, without recourse to either melodrama or callousness. As Deborah Nelson shows, this stance offers an important counter-tradition to the familiar postwar poles of emotional expressivity on the one hand and cool irony on the other. Ultimately, in its insistence on facing reality without consolation or compensation, this austere &#x201c;school of the unsentimental&#x201d; offers new ways to approach suffering in both its spectacular forms and all of its ordinariness.</p></p><p><b>Deborah Nelson</b> is associate professor of English at the University of Chicago. She is the author of <i>Pursuing Privacy in Cold War America</i>.&#x201c;<i>Tough Enough</i> is a brilliant defense of coldness. Nelson gathers together six extraordinarily well-known modern women who, one way or another, and often in deep&#x2014;and sometimes conspicuous&#x2014;concert, championed theological, philosophical, and political principles, as well as aesthetic practices, which together constitute an important school of the unsentimental. For those who are devoted to these six figures, who can&#x2019;t get enough of them, and who always knew that they somehow belonged together, this illuminating book will be welcomed as a revelation and confirmation.&#x201d; (Jeff Nunokawa, author of Note Book)<br><br>"Deborah Nelson concedes that the six women whose careers are canvassed in her 2017 book&nbsp;<i>Tough Enough: Arbus, Arendt, Didion, McCarthy, Sontag, Weil</i>&nbsp;would definitely not appreciate being classed together, by gender or any other category. Thankfully for us, Nelson is undeterred: she boldly gathers Diane Arbus, Hannah Arendt, Joan Didion, Mary McCarthy, Susan Sontag, and Simone Weil into a common room to stage a wonderfully readable, engaging, provocative conversation about their similarities in style and outlook." (<i>Lori Jo Marso | Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"Behind Nelson&#x2019;s cool rhetoric lurks an exciting thinker . . . . Raising the question of toughness as a methodology and style is compelling and timely, especially at a time when women are both assuming more powerful roles in public life and having to fight against hostile stereotypes. Nelson is intellectually tough enough to take on these six case studies." (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks to Nelson, we now know that&nbsp;these &#x2018;tough&#x2019; women share the trait of unsentimentality, which is not a character defect, as their critics often claimed, but a principled commitment, even a style: austere, pitiless, clinical, unwavering. Frankly feminist, <i>Tough Enough</i> argues that while sentimentalism has earned enormous critical attention, the unsentimental has largely gone unprocessed by literary critics and theorists. This superb book about women, style, criticism, politics, and misogyny is the beginning of the end of that.&#x201d; (Bonnie Honig, author of Antigone, Interrupted)<br><br>"Agree or disagree with the case for unsentimentality, <i>Tough Enough</i> is well worth the time: for Nelson&#x2019;s insights on some landmark works of the 20th (and for Joan Didion, the 21st) century, and for its considerations on how to face suffering. How to see it and wholly appreciate it without trying to inhabit its emotional space. And to wrest something meaningful from that." (<i>WBUR, The ARTery</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Tough Enough</i>&nbsp;is an important contribution to literary, gender, affect, and trauma studies, and an all-too-timely read in our current political climate, for academic and non-academic readers alike. At a time when the study of the humanities is under threat, Nelson proves, again and again, that analysis of evidence, critical thinking, and argumentation are vital tools for confronting brutal political realities. May we all be tough enough to approach the world as Weil, Arendt, McCarthy, Sontag, Arbus, and Didion.&#x201d; (<i>Jacquelyn Ardam | Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"Nelson is primarily interested in the aesthetic, political, and philosophical concerns guiding the work these women produced; thus, <i>Tough Enough</i> is light on biographical detail, heavy on fine-grained stylistic analysis. Anyone who already admires Weil, Arendt, McCarthy, Sontag, Didion, or Arbus will no doubt appreciate this approach, and Nelson &#x2014; obviously aware that most readers won't be familiar with <i>all</i> of her subjects &#x2014; provides some context for each of them." (<i>Washington Independent Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"Living with suffering, living with failure, living with facts, living without comfort&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the kind of life, collectively proposed by the women here, that unsentimental thinking demands. Faced with this challenge, it&#x2019;s no wonder that many of us prefer self-justifying stories. But what becomes clear in reading Nelson&#x2019;s account of these six women is that, for all their flaws and disagreements, they represent a way of living that is attainable. To seek out the facts, to desire the truth, is to create the potential for transformation and response. Unsentimentality is intimately linked with the capacity for love, kindness, rebuke, and hope. As an old book once had it: the truth will set you free." (<i>Education and Culture</i>)<br><br>"Unsurprisingly, her subjects' unsentimental attitudes toward human suffering frequently earned them scorn and derision from allies and enemies alike for supposedly being heartless or cruel. Nelson complicates this predominant view not only by examining the gendered presumptions that constrained women's public self-expression but also by illustrating how and why these women's tough-minded perspective is part of a profoundly ethical and deeply engaged response to the ample brutality of the contemporary world."<br> &nbsp; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"Her book contributes significantly to our understanding of these remarkable women&#x2014;Simone Weil, Hannah Arendt, Mary McCarthy, Susan Sontag, Diane Arbus, and Joan Didion&#x2014; and immeasurably to our thinking about how we as critics understand representations of suffering."<br> &nbsp; (<i>American Literary History Online Review</i>)</p><h2>Fractal Geometry: Mathematical Foundations and Applications</h2><p>An accessible introduction to fractals, useful as a text or reference.

(Carolyn Arends, director of education, Renovar�)<br><br>"Jan does something few contemporary lectio guides do: she preserves the discipline of study that was part of the ancient tradition of lectio divina by providing historical and cultural background for the chosen texts. Her selection of passages is nothing short of brilliant&#x2015;theologically central, experientially deep, and comprehensively transformational. This guide can be the spark that causes the Word of God to be a fire in your bones once again." (Howard Baker, assistant professor of Christian formation, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"In her writing as in person, Jan Johnson finds ordinary ways to guide us into extraordinary experiences&#x2015;into the very presence of God&#x2015;with an attentive ear for what God may have to say. What a personal yet practical way to bring the practice of lectio divina into daily life! The coaching Jan provides is spot-on soul guidance and will most certainly help readers greatly increase their capacity for meeting God in Scripture." (Mindy Caliguire, founder, Soul Care)<br><br>"Finally, a book about engaging Scripture for personal and group transformation has arrived! Jan Johnson has done a great service for evangelicals who have lost an imagination for reading the Bible outside of study or quick inspiration. <em>Meeting God in Scripture</em> is a beautiful reclaiming of lectio divina for our time. Read, ponder, pray, and meditate on the beauty of Scripture as described in these pages and prepare to be changed!" (Keith J. Matthews, professor of spiritual formation and leadership, Azusa Pacific Seminary)<br><br>"What a great title&#x2015;and what a great book! God delights to meet with his children in Scripture, and if you're ready to try out a different approach, let Jan Johnson, an experienced and trusted Bible teacher, lead the way with this sound and practical guide. You'll have the opportunity to meditate on thematically arranged passages from various sections of the whole Bible. I really appreciated the just-enough background comments that helped illuminate key words or concepts so that I could put aside immediate questions and enter more fully into the passage. The structured framework and thoughtful questions prodded my pondering to allow God's work in my heart. This guidebook offers nourishing soul food for those with little or much experience in Bible meditation, individually or in a group setting." (Klaus Issler, author of Living into the Life of Jesus)<br><br>"What a great help! Jan is truly a thoughtful and trusted guide. I love the way this book is laid out and the overarching direction it takes us in. Carefully working through this book will change your life." (Nathan Foster, director of community life, Renovar�, author of The Making of an Ordinary Saint)<br><br>"Jesus spoke of the wise disciple who 'brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old,' and this book does just that. It helps the follower of Jesus practice the call of Scripture to be people who meditate frequently on God's truth. The guidance given here is both time-tested by respected ancient writers and practice-tested in everyday life, as this book has grown out of years of fruitful Bible study leadership. There is a thoughtful grounding of the prayer and meditation exercises in the historical meaning of the text." (James C. Wilhoit, professor of core studies, Scripture Press Professor of Christian Education, Wheaton College)<br><br>"I've found encountering God in Scripture to be my favorite and most life-giving spiritual practice. In <em>Meeting God in Scripture</em>, Jan serves us as a seasoned guide to the classic spiritual practice of lectio divina through these forty well-crafted and inviting meditations. More than an idea book, this is an experience book. I hope you'll read it and grow in your enjoyment of God in Scripture." (Alan Fadling, president and founder, Unhurried Living, author of An Unhurried Life)<br><br>"Jan Johnson has written a wonderful and clear guide to lectio divina. . . . [It] will be of tremendous help to everyone desiring to know God more deeply and to become more like Jesus." (Siang-Yang Tan, professor of psychology, Fuller Theological Seminary, author of Counseling and Psychotherapy)<br><br>"When we experience abandonment, we look for guideposts to bring about renewal. These Scripture meditation exercises invite us into the presence of God, who creates a safe place for us and draws us into a culture for formation and growth."

Heartwarming descriptions of a Christmas Eve trip by stagecoach, holiday games, services at the village church, and a sumptuous dinner are enhanced with more than 100 charming sketches by noted illustrator Randolph Caldecott.</p><p>Warmly convivial and delightfully festival, this charming and long forgotten holiday classic, by one of American literature's most beloved writers, was inspired, in part, by Dickens' A Christmas Carol and other celebrations of oldtime Yule. <p> Splendid suppers and rural churches, cheerful dances and hearty spirits imbue this short novel with the magic of the season. This festive work, first published in 1896, deserves to be a holiday tradition alongside Dickens in the celebrations of the winter solstice.</p>Washington Irving (1783-1859) was an American author, short story writer, essayist, poet, travel book writer, biographer, and columnist. He has been called the father of the American short story. He is best known for &#39;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&#39; and &#39;Rip Van Winkle.&#39;</p><h2>No Bull: My Life In and Out of Markets</h2><p>When the official history of twentieth-century Wall Street is written, it will certainly contain more than a few pages on Michael Steinhardt. One of the most successful money managers in the history of "The Street," Steinhardt far outshone his peers by achieving an average annual return of over thirty percent-significantly greater than that of every market benchmark. During his almost thirty-year tenure as a hedge fund manager, he amassed vast wealth for his investors and himself. One dollar invested with Steinhardt Partners L.P., his flagship hedge fund, at its inception in 1967 would have been worth $462 when he retired from active money management in 1995. <p>No Bull offers an account of some of the investment strategies that drove Michael Steinhardt's historic success as a hedge fund manager including a focus on his skills as an industry analyst and consummate stock picker. He also reveals how his uncanny talent for knowing when to trade against the prevailing market trend-a talent that was not always appreciated by several erstwhile high-profile clients-resulted in many of his greatest successes. Here he provides detailed accounts of some of his most sensational coups-including his momentous decision, in 1981, to stake everything on bonds-and his equally sensational failures, such as his disastrous foray into global macro-trading in the mid-1990s.</p> <p>At the same time, No Bull is the rags-to-riches story of a boy from Bensonhurst and his rise from the streets of Brooklyn to the heights of Wall Street. In a thoroughly engaging narrative, Steinhardt relates the early influences that shaped his attitudes toward life and success, as well as the beginning of his love affair with stock investing. Further, he chronicles his dawning awareness of the need for a purpose in life beyond the acquisition of wealth and how it led to his decision to retire and redirect his energies. We learn about his experiences as the chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council for nearly a decade, as well as his innovative thinking and ambitious projects to strengthen the Jewish community.</p> <p>The inspiring true story of a Wall Street genius and world-class philanthropist, No Bull is an unforgettable read for finance professionals and students of human nature alike.<br> Michael Steinhardt is one of the most successful money managers in the history of Wall Street. He is also widely known for his philanthropic activities, particularly in the Jewish community-most notably as cofounder with Charles Bronfman of birthright israel, a program whose mission is to provide a free educational opportunity for every young Jewish person of the Diaspora to visit Israel.</p></p><p>Critical Praise for NO BULL<br> <br> "Michael Steinhardt rode bull and bear markets to great success for himself and his investors. Since closing his fund in 1995 he has continued his successful streak in more philanthropic enterprises. But what is ultimately compelling about Steinhardt is his drive, no matter the endeavor. No Bull is a highly readable inside look into the man, his successes, and his motivations."-George Soros, Chairman, Soros Fund Management, and Chairman,<br> <br> The Soros Foundations Network<br> <br> "Michael Steinhardt has written a fascinating history of his experiences in the tumultuous economic times of the last forty years. His reflections are endlessly interesting, totally candid, very instructive, moving, warm, and in many ways, inspirational. No Bull is an important resource for anyone interested in markets, the evolution of a key player, his ideas and strategies, and his deeply felt personal philosophy."-Laurence A. Tisch, Co-Chairman, Loews Corporation<br> <br> "Michael Steinhardt has penned a joyous book about his rich (in every way) experiences on Wall Street, filled with angst . . . and reminiscent of a World of our Fathers as only Steinhardt would know. I always knew he was the world's best money manager but I didn't know that he could write, and he writes better than he trades!"-James J. Cramer, Markets Commentator for TheStreet.com and CNBC<br> <br> "Michael Steinhardt long ago earned Wall Street's highest accolade, 'money maker.' With this fine memoir, he earns a new accolade, 'story teller.'"-James Grant, Editor, Grant's Interest Rate Observer<br> <br> "No Bull is a memoir rich in language, in detail, and in self-awareness. It is good that this is so because the life about which he writes demands it; it is not only a deeply complicated narrative in its own right but one that touches public issues of concern to us all. Do not be mistaken: Steinhardt is more than a money manager."-Marty Peretz, Editor-in-Chief, The New RepublicMICHAEL STEINHARDT is one of the most successful money managers in the history of Wall Street. He is also widely known for his philanthropic activities, particularly in the Jewish community-most notably as cofounder with Charles Bronfman of birthright israel, a program whose mission is to provide a free educational opportunity for every young Jewish person of the Diaspora to visit Israel.</p><h2>Mathematics: Journey from Basic Mathematics through Intermediate Algebra</h2><p>The Aufmann/Lockwood MATHEMATICS: JOURNEY FROM BASIC MATHEMATICS THROUGH INTERMEDIATE ALGEBRA delivers learning objectives organized by section in 21 modules spanning the entire developmental mathematics sequence--basic mathematics, prealgebra, introductory algebra, and intermediate algebra.

Each participant can see how their comments contribute (or don&#39;t) to the coherence and order of the group&#39;s thinking. The first full-length book to bring dialogue mapping to a wider audience, Dialogue Mapping provides an exciting new conceptual framework that will change the way readers view projects and project management.</p><p>Dialogue mapping reflects a new approach to meetings and collaboration, in which collective intelligence is achieved through framing powerful questions and rigorous and systematic exploration of their possible answers. A key insight of this approach is that <i>shared display</i> of the dialogue map promotes <i>shared understanding of and commitment</i> <i>to</i> the collective result. <p>In the first part of <i>Dialogue Mapping,</i> Jeffrey Conklin introduces the key concepts:</p> <ul> <li><b>Wicked problems</b>: for which you don&#x2019;t really understand the problem until a solution has been formulated.</li> <li><b>Social complexity</b>: the large number and wide diversity of stakeholders whose participation is essential to a robust outcome.</li> <li><b>Opportunity-driven problem solving:</b> intelligent thinking is not linear! Creative cognition naturally jumps all over the problem-solution space.</li> <li><b>Shared understanding:</b> the most expedient means for overcoming fragmentation is forging shared understanding of all aspects of the problem-solution space.</li> </ul> <p>The remaining sections provide a hands-on tutorial for practitioners looking for a radically inclusive approach to collective problem solving. </p> <p>"This is an excellent guide for all those interested in durable collaborative solutions in our increasingly tough business climates today."<br> <b>&#x2015;John C. Mitchell, former President, Business Printer Division, Lexmark International, Inc.</b></p> <p>"Jeff Conklin pioneered this field, showing the connection between conversations (dialogue) and solving wicked problems.

The roughly 12-per-page colored drawings are dated, of course--the humans far more than the animals, funnily enough--but they've aged in a way that adds to their charm rather than detracting from it. (<i>Phonograph</i> may take some explaining; ditto <i>typewriter</i>, which we recently heard described as "like a computer, only with paper instead of a screen.") The 1,350 words are well balanced between the obvious stuff--common nouns and verbs--and more abstract language, from <i>about</i> to <i>yet</i>. Each word is accompanied by a drawing and an illustrative sentence. Along the way, naturally, we meet a wacky menagerie of humans and animals: "Aaron the alligator making more machines," "Aunt Ada standing on her head," etc. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Richard Farr</i>Illus. in full color. &#34;The picture carries the meaning in this dictionary of over a thousand elementary words from &#39;Aaron&#39; the alligator to a nest full of &#39;zyxuzpf&#39; birds.

Known as the "Modular" engine family, the 4.6L engines employed new overhead cams, multi-valve performance, distributorless ignition, and more. This engine had new technology for its time, and it proved to be an extremely durable workhorse that logged hundreds of thousands of miles in police and taxi applications as well as light-duty trucks. And, of course, hotter versions, and even supercharged versions, found their way into performance applications such as Mustang GTs and Cobras.</p><p>By 2011, Ford wanted something hotter and more current, especially for its flagship Mustang GT and GT350 models, which were suddenly competing with new 6.2L LS3 engines in Camaros and 6.4L Hemi engines in Challengers. Enter Ford's new 5.0L &#x201c;Coyote&#x201d; engine with Twin Independent Variable Cam Timing (Ti-VCT); it was an evolution of the earlier 4.6L and 5.4L Modular designs. Although the new Coyote engine had increased displacement, it still had far fewer cubes than the competition. Despite less displacement, the Coyote could hold its own against bigger Chevy and Chrysler mills thanks to advanced technology, such as 4V heads with better port and valvetrain geometry. The Coyote is also Ford's first foray into technology that includes Ti-VCT and cam-torque-actuated (CTA) function, which is a fancy way of saying variable cam timing for an incredible power curve over a broader RPM range. </p><p>Even with all of this new technology, there is always room for improvement.

Vivid in its descriptions friendship and loss, of daily struggle and attainment, this book offers its readers an unforgettable portrait of a pioneer woman and her ability to be endure.</p><p>MOLLY GLOSS is the author of Wild Life, winner of the James Tiptree Award,<br>The Jump-Off Creek, a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award, and The Dazzle of<br>Day, a New York Times Notable Book. She lives in Portland, Oregon.Set in the high mountain country of Oregon during the 1890s, this first novel is a quiet, unsparing portrait of pioneer life, recounted simply and without romanticism. Drawing on pioneer diaries, journals and hand-me-down stories of her own ancestors, Gloss displays a deep awareness not only of the brutal hardships of frontier life, but also of the moral codes and emotional attachments of the people who settled there. Drawn by the freedom the West offers, Lydia Sanderson leaves a disappointing marriage in Pennsylvania and comes to Jump-Off Creek to homestead a place of her own. Tim Whiteaker, "gone cowboying" since the age of 13, and his partner, the half-Indian Blue Odell, raise cattle nearby. Three wolfers, squatting on abandoned property near Jump-Off Creek and walking the thin edge of the law in order to earn a marginal living, provide much of the tension within the novel. The author's intimate understanding of the harsh physical conditions and of the rituals and practices of frontier life (there are long descriptions of how to brand cattle and how to mend a roof) sometimes overshadows a deeper delineation of character. However, most of the scenes are handled with a restraint that communicates the characters' endemic loneliness, and the dialogue, though spare, is rich enough to convey their emotional conflicts. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Clinical Hematology and Fundamentals of Hemostasis</h2><p>Provide your students with three textbooks for the price of one!

Written and first read during the prolonged, tragic world war between totalitarian and democratic forces, Niebuhr&#x2019;s book took up the timely question of how democracy as a political system could best be defended.</p> <p> Most proponents of democracy, Niebuhr claimed, were &#x201c;children of light,&#x201d; who had optimistic but na�ve ideas about how society could be rid of evil and governed by enlightened reason. They needed, he believed, to absorb some of the wisdom and strength of the &#x201c;children of darkness,&#x201d; whose ruthless cynicism and corrupt, anti-democratic politics should otherwise be repudiated. He argued for a prudent, liberal understanding of human society that took the measure of every group&#x2019;s self-interest and was chastened by a realistic understanding of the limits of power. It is in the foreword to this book that he wrote, &#x201c;Man&#x2019;s capacity for justice makes democracy possible; but man&#x2019;s inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary.&#x201d;</p> <p>This edition includes a new introduction by the theologian and Niebuhr scholar Gary Dorrien in which he elucidates the work&#x2019;s significance and places it firmly into the arc of Niebuhr&#x2019;s career.</p></p><p><b>Reinhold Niebuhr </b>(1892&#x2013;1971)<i></i>taught for many years at Union Theological Seminary,&nbsp;in New York City, as well as lecturing&nbsp;and preaching all over the country.

Excellence in All Things. </b><br><br>There&#x2019;s no denying that Tony Dungy was a master of his craft. During his twenty-eight-year career, Dungy rose to become one of the most successful and beloved coaches in the history of the National Football League. In his first job as a head coach, Dungy did the seemingly impossible by turning the perennially pathetic Tampa Bay Buccaneers into a playoff-bound powerhouse. Then, after a move to Indianapolis, Dungy led the Colts to their first Super Bowl victory in thirty-six years, making Dungy the first African American head coach to ever hoist the Vince Lombardi Trophy.</p><p>As anyone close to Dungy will tell you, the soft-spoken coach is intensely passionate about the pursuit of excellence, holding the highest standards for himself and his players. But what inspired Dungy to work with such a passion for exceptionalism? Much like the other masters throughout this book, Dungy&#x2019;s motivation for excellence in his work stemmed from something much deeper, more sustainable, and more God honoring than the pursuit of fame, fortune, and trophies. Dungy was inspired by his parents&#x2014;both of whom were masterful educators&#x2014;to pursue excellence as a means of glorifying God and serving others. Remembering his parents&#x2019; example, Dungy said, &#x201c;My parents were definitions of excellence in teaching. It was important to them to be the best that they could be&#x2014;not for personal reasons, but that was their concept of serving. They wanted to serve people in the best way possible.&#x201d;</p><p>That commitment to mastery had a lasting impact on Dungy, who has thought a lot about excellence throughout his career. &#x201c;Excellence is doing something at the very highest level it can be done using all your capabilities and everything God has given you,&#x201d; Dungy said. &#x201c;I talk about excellence a lot, because I think from a Christian perspective, that can get lost sometimes....We don&#x2019;t always think of excellence as a Christian concept, but I think God does desire us to be excellent at what we do....Just because we&#x2019;re Christians doesn&#x2019;t mean we should take the approach to just move forward and let the Lord handle it....He wants us to be excellent in what we do. He&#x2019;s placed us in our careers....We do have a responsibility to be the very best we can be in whatever field we decide to take up. We all run to receive a prize and to win. I never want to forget that part of it. We should run to win.&#x201d;</p><p>Throughout his career, Dungy won a lot. If there was ever a doubt that Dungy was a master of his craft as a coach, his induction into the NFL&#x2019;s Pro Football Hall of Fame certainly removed that skepticism. As Dungy took the stage in Canton, Ohio, to receive the Ring of Excellence, the audience of adoring fans, family, and former players erupted in rapturous applause. Clearly these fans were celebrating Dungy&#x2019;s excellence on the field. But as anyone who knows Dungy will tell you, they were applauding something much more; they were celebrating a man who understands that, while he is called to be excellent in his work, his faith commands him to be excellent in <i>all</i> things, including as a husband and father.</p><p>In a moving speech, Marvin Harrison (Dungy&#x2019;s former player and fellow Hall of Fame inductee) addressed his former coach directly, saying, &#x201c;Coach Dungy. My final head coach. I could sit up here for...fifteen minutes and tell you about how important it was to have you as my coach and talk about football. But what you brought to our team and to me was more important than anything. You taught us how to be teammates. You taught us how to be men. But the most important thing is you taught us about fatherhood....So, I want to thank you for that.&#x201d;</p><p>Harrison&#x2019;s sentiment has been echoed by countless players Dungy has coached and mentored throughout his career. But Dungy didn&#x2019;t just tell others how to be an excellent father; he modeled it. I grew up in Tampa Bay, and I still remember seeing Dungy with his kids at sporting events where my friends and I were playing. Even at the height of his career, Dungy always seemed to make the time to cheer his kids on from the sidelines.</p><p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re only focused on excellence in your job or excellence on the field, you will get totally out of balance and out of whack,&#x201d; Dungy said. &#x201c;Yes, I need to be excellent as a coach. I need to be excellent as a Christian. I need to be excellent as a father. I need to be excellent as a person in the community and strive for that excellence everywhere and not just in one area.&#x201d;</p><p>Dungy&#x2019;s comments bring to mind the motto of the late great pastor, Dr. D. James Kennedy, who encouraged his congregation to pursue &#x201c;excellence in all things and all things to God&#x2019;s glory.&#x201d; While this book is primarily about excellence in your chosen work, Kennedy and Dungy remind us of a biblical truth that is critical to understand before we progress past this first chapter: As Christians, God has called us to be excellent in <i>all</i> things, not just in our chosen vocation. 1 Corinthians 10:31 makes clear the standard we are called to: &#x201c;Whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.&#x201d; In <i>whatever</i> we do, we are to do it all for the glory of God, never settling for anything short of excellence.</p><p><i>Glorify</i> is a word we throw around so much in Christian circles that it has become tragically difficult to define. In fact, one of the most highlighted passages in the Kindle edition of my previous book is John Piper&#x2019;s definition of glorify. Since so many people found that definition helpful, allow me to reintroduce it here. According to Piper, &#x201c;&#x2018;Glorifying&#x2019; means feeling and thinking and acting in ways that <i>reflect</i> his greatness, that make much of God, that give evidence of the supreme greatness of all his attributes and the all-satisfying beauty of his manifold perfections&#x201d; (emphasis added).</p><p>You and I are called to reflect God&#x2019;s greatness and imitate his character to the world. This is the very essence of what it means to glorify God. But what is his character? Scripture describes God in many ways, but it is his character of excellence that is perhaps most visible to us. So, when Scripture commands that in &#x201c;whatever you do,&#x201d; you &#x201c;do it all for the glory of God,&#x201d; we are being called to the passionate pursuit of excellence in whatever we commit ourselves to.</p><p>All of us have been called to multiple roles in life. We have been called to be excellent wives and husbands, mothers and fathers, daughters and sons, friends and church members. If we are going to fulfill all these callings with excellence while also pursuing excellence in our chosen work, it is going to require a tremendous amount of focus in our careers. Again, recall Dr. Anders Ericsson&#x2019;s study, which states that mastery of any vocation requires roughly ten thousand hours of &#x201c;purposeful practice.&#x201d; The reality is that excellence requires an unusual amount of hard work and dedication. Given this, and the many things outside our careers that God has called us to be excellent in, there is simply no way we can pursue mastery at many things professionally at the same time. It defies the laws of science and time. It is precisely because we are called to be excellent in all things that we can&#x2019;t commit to being excellent at many things.</p><p>You and I have a choice to be either a master of none or a master of one. We must pick a path. The path to excellence in our work is the path of singularity. If we want to make our greatest contribution to the world for the glory of God and the good of others, we are going to have to adopt the mind-set of a craftsperson and get really focused and insanely good at the thing God has put us on this earth to do.</p><p>If you are still harboring some resistance to this idea that the path to excellence is the path of less but better, I&#x2019;m willing to bet that you have been a victim of being sold one (or more) of three lies about work and calling that are so pervasive today they often go unchecked. If we are to pursue excellence in all things for the glory of God and the good of others, we need to challenge the following conventional wisdom and replace these lies with biblical truths.</p><p><b><br>Lie #1: You Can Be Anything You Want to Be</b></p><p>John Mark Comer would love to have been a professional basketball player. As a kid, he loved watching <i>Pistol Pete</i>, the classic movie about Pete Maravich who, through years of practice, grew to become a basketball great. Comer dreamed of living a similar story and eventually playing for the National Basketball Association (NBA). &#x201c;There was just one problem,&#x201d; Comer said. &#x201c;I suck at basketball. I mean, I&#x2019;m really, <i>really</i> bad at it. It took me a while to figure that out, and then I had to go bury the dream in my backyard, along with my ball and jersey. It was a sad day.&#x201d;</p><p>Today, Comer is the teaching pastor at Bridgetown Church in Portland, Oregon. He&#x2019;s also one of my favorite authors.[1] One of the things I love about Comer is that he is super clear about the work God has called him to master. &#x201c;Usually God&#x2019;s calling is a short list&#x2014;just a few things,&#x201d; Comer said. &#x201c;In my case, I&#x2019;m called to lead my church, teach the Scriptures, and bring my family along for the ride. That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m saying yes to.&#x201d;</p><p>But while Comer is clear on his mission, he empathizes with others still searching for the work God has created them to do. This is largely due to Comer&#x2019;s recognition that for way too long we have been sold the pervasive lie that we can be anything we want to be. &#x201c;I was brought up in a culture that essentially said, John Mark, you can do anything you put your mind to,&#x201d; Comer said. &#x201c;If you work hard enough, if you believe in yourself, if you&#x2019;re patient, you can do anything. This is such a middle-class-and-above American way to think. Nobody in the developing world would ever talk like that....But...this idea of &#x2018;I can be anything I want&#x2019; is bred into us by our ancestry. And it&#x2019;s not all bad. It gave me the courage to dream and ideate and step out in life.</p><p>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s also dangerous because, sadly, it&#x2019;s not true. I can&#x2019;t be anything I want to be, no matter how hard I work or how much I believe in myself. All I can be is me. Who the Creator made John Mark to be.&#x201d;</p><p>Comer hits the nail on the head, expounding upon a truth that is embedded deeply in Scripture: God has created each of us uniquely, with particular passions and gifts. The Bible doesn&#x2019;t portray God as some manager of a cosmic manufacturing plant, pushing a button and sitting back to watch the production of millions of homogenous humans. No, all throughout Scripture, the biblical authors use beautiful language to portray God as an intentional craftsman, putting time and great care into the design of each unique human being. Consider the following verses (emphasis added):</p><p>Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart. (Jeremiah 1:5)</p><p>Your hands shaped me and made me. Will you now turn and destroy me? Remember that you <i>molded</i> me like clay. (Job 10:8&#x2013;9)</p><p>For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother&#x2019;s womb. (Psalm 139:13)</p><p>You get the point. God has meticulously designed each one of us. As the apostle Paul tells us in Romans 12:6, this includes God&#x2019;s granting of &#x201c;different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us.&#x201d; God created you and me with a unique mix of passions and talents, and he has called us to steward those gifts well. In other words, there are certain kinds of work that God has designed us to do exceptionally well and, naturally, other kinds of work at which we are unlikely to excel.</p><p>But haven&#x2019;t technology, access to information, and economic prosperity made it possible for us to choose to do any work imaginable? No doubt. We are living at a time when we have an unprecedented number of options for our work. Now more than ever we have the ability to choose virtually any career we want. However, just because we have more options doesn&#x2019;t mean we can do everything with excellence.</p><p>Pretend for a second that you have decided you want your car to be a boat. You live near a lake and have the option to drive your car into the water; but if you do, you aren&#x2019;t going to get very far. Your car may be an excellent car, but it is never going to be an exceptional boat. Why? Because your car was designed to be a car, not a boat.</p><p>The same is true for you and me in our careers. Yes, you can choose to be anything you want to be. But if our mandate is &#x201c;excellence in all things and all things for God&#x2019;s glory,&#x201d; we would be wise to understand how God has created us and choose work that aligns with his design, ensuring that we make our greatest possible contribution to the world. If we choose work that is out of line with the gifts God has given us, we may be temporarily satisfied, but we won&#x2019;t be on the path to mastery, with the potential to become the very best versions of ourselves for the sake of God&#x2019;s glory and the good of others.</p><p>No matter how hard John Mark Comer tries, he&#x2019;s never going to play basketball in the NBA. He may enjoy shooting hoops in the front yard with his kids, but basketball is never going to be the one thing that Comer does masterfully well. In the words of the old US Army slogan, we can only &#x201c;Be all we can be.&#x201d; You and I aren&#x2019;t called to &#x201c;Be all we <i>want</i> to be&#x201d; or &#x201c;Be all we choose to be.&#x201d; We are called to be the most excellent versions of who God has <i>created</i> us to be. Comer put this well when he said, &#x201c;Our job isn&#x2019;t to fit into some mold or prove something to the world; it&#x2019;s to unlock who God&#x2019;s made us to be, and then go be it.&#x201d;</p><p>The lie that we can be anything we want to be is particularly dangerous because it paves the way to a second, more subtle lie that so many of us have fallen for.</p><p>&nbsp;<br><br></p><br><p>[1] Seriously, if you have yet to read Comer&#x2019;s <i>Garden City</i>, put this book down and go read that.</p></p><h2>Parenting Today&#39;s Teens: A Practical Devotional</h2><p><p>Mark Gregston--speaker, author, and director of one of America's leading Christian residential treatment facilities for troubled teens--pours the wisdom of his experience with kids in crisis into a daily devotional.</p> <p>Based on Gregston's nationally syndicated daily radio feature and weekly broadcast, this invaluable resource for parents helps them maintain a biblical perspective as they face some of life's most heart-wrenching challenges.

After providing basic information about water itself and the chemical composition of water in environmental systems, the text covers the necessary theory (thermodynamics, activity, and kinetics) and background material to solve problems. It emphasizes that both equilibrium and kinetic processes are important in aquatic systems. The book does not merely focus on inorganic constituents, but also on the fate and reactions of organic chemicals.<br><br>The solving of quantitative equilibrium and kinetic problems using mathematical, graphical, and computational tools is emphasized throughout presentations on acid-base chemistry, complexation of metal ions, solubility of minerals, and oxidation-reduction reactions. The use of these problem-solving tools is then extended in the presentation of topics relevant to natural systems, including dissolved oxygen, nutrient chemistry, geochemical controls on chemical composition, photochemistry, and natural organic matter. The kinetics and equilibria relevant to engineered systems (e.g., chlorination and disinfection chemistry, sorption and surface chemistry) and organic contaminant chemistry are also discussed. Numerous in-chapter examples that show the application of theory and demonstrate how problems are solved using algebraic, graphical, and computer-based techniques are included.

Before Vasari&#x2019;s extraordinary book, art was considered a technical skill, and artists were mere decorators and craftsmen.

For a variety of reasons, both theoretical and practical, the hopes placed in de-reification as a tool of revolutionary emancipation proved vain. In these original and imaginative essays, delivered as the Tanner Lectures at the University of California, Berkeley in 2005, the distinguished third-generation Frankfurt School philosopher Axel Honneth attempts to rescue the concept of reification by recasting it in terms of the philosophy of recognition he has been developing over the past two decades. Three distinguished political and social theorists: Judith Butler, Raymond Geuss, and Jonathan Lear, respond with hard questions about the central anthropological premise of his argument, the assumption that prior to cognition there is a fundamental experience of intersubjective recognition that can provide a normative standard by which current social relations can be judged wanted. Honneth listens carefully to their criticism and provides a powerful defense of his position.<br></p><p><br><strong>Axel Honneth</strong> is Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Institut f�r Sozialforschung, University of Frankfurt, Germany<br><br>"[These lectures] are continually engaging, thought provoking, and - rare blessing - a pleasure to read. Without doubt they will stimulate lively discussion of these important issues." - Sean Sayers, <em>Mind</em><p></p><br>"Honneth has confirmed in this work what he has established in those previous to it; that his work is of the highest order, at once rigorous, serious, and constructive, pushing the edges of critical theory, and his focus on the concept of recognition offers exacting critique, penetrating analysis, and hopeful transformation of our contemporary social and political order. Reification is a must-read for those both within and outside of social theory circles, who, by having a new look at an old idea, will be presented at once with a creative proposal to reform political and social institutions with the persistence of recognition and yet will remain troubles by then with the persistence of reification." - Michael Sohn, <em>Political Theology</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Knowing God&#39;s Purpose For Your Life</h2><p>If the desire to know God&#39;s guidance is a sign of spiritual health, then this meaty devotional is a sure prescription for a vigorous spiritual appetite.

It is regarded as one of the most significant works of religious English literature, has been translated into more than 200 languages, and has never been out of print. It has also been cited as the first novel written in English. Bunyan began his work while in the Bedfordshire county prison for violations of the Conventicle Act, which prohibited the holding of religious services outside the auspices of the established Church of England. Early Bunyan scholars such as John Brown believed The Pilgrim's Progress was begun in Bunyan's second, shorter imprisonment for six months in 1675, but more recent scholars such as Roger Sharrock believe that it was begun during Bunyan's initial, more lengthy imprisonment from 1660 to 1672 right after he had written his spiritual autobiography Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners. The English text comprises 108,260 words and is divided into two parts, each reading as a continuous narrative with no chapter divisions. The first part was completed in 1677 and entered into the Stationers' Register on 22 December 1677. It was licensed and entered in the "Term Catalogue" on 18 February 1678, which is looked upon as the date of first publication.[10] After the first edition of the first part in 1678, an expanded edition, with additions written after Bunyan was freed, appeared in 1679. The Second Part appeared in 1684. There were eleven editions of the first part in John Bunyan's lifetime, published in successive years from 1678 to 1685 and in 1688, and there were two editions of the second part, published in 1684 and 1686. The allegory of this book has antecedents in a large number of Christian devotional works that speak of the soul's path to Heaven, from the Lyke-Wake Dirge forward. Bunyan's allegory stands out above his predecessors because of his simple and effective prose style, steeped in Biblical texts and cadences. He confesses his own na�vet� in the verse prologue to the book: "I did not think To shew to all the World my Pen and Ink In such a mode; I only thought to make I knew not what: nor did I undertake Thereby to please my Neighbour; no not I; I did it mine own self to gratifie." Bunyan's inspiration? Due to many similarities &#x2013; some more definite than others &#x2013; it could be argued that he had access to Dante's Commedia. The Pilgrim's Progress may therefore be a distillation of the entire 'pilgrimage' that the 14th Century Italian penned. Because of the widespread longtime popularity of The Pilgrim's Progress, Christian's hazards &#x2014; whether originally from Bunyan or borrowed by him from the Bible&#x2014;the "Slough of Despond", the "Hill Difficulty", "Valley of the Shadow of Death", "Doubting Castle", and the "Enchanted Ground", his temptations (the wares of "Vanity Fair" and the pleasantness of "By-Path Meadow"), his foes ("Apollyon" and "Giant Despair"), and the helpful stopping places he visits (the "House of the Interpreter", the "House Beautiful", the "Delectable Mountains", and the "Land of Beulah") have become commonly used phrases proverbial in English. For example, "One has one's own Slough of Despond to trudge through." The Pilgrim's Progress was much more popular than its predecessors. Bunyan's plain style breathes life into the abstractions of the anthropomorphized temptations and abstractions that Christian encounters and with whom he converses on his course to Heaven. Samuel Johnson said that "this is the great merit of the book, that the most cultivated man cannot find anything to praise more highly, and the child knows nothing more amusing." Three years after its publication (1681), it was reprinted in colonial America, and was widely read in the Puritan colonies.</p><p>Original Classic TextKessinger Publishing reprints over 1,500 similar titles all available through Amazon.com.</p><h2>The Monk (Dover Thrift Editions)</h2><p><p>Supernatural events, women in distress, and a corrupt clergy were popular themes in the Gothic novels of the 19th century. All of those elements, along with murder, incest, and the excesses of the Spanish Inquisition, are present in <i>The Monk</i> (1796), one of the era's bestselling and most influential novels.<br>Set in a sinister Capuchin monastery in Madrid, the ever-more horrifying narrative recounts the experiences of a lustful and devious abbot, who forgoes his monastic vows in the face of temptation and sexual obsession. Seduced by an evil woman and intoxicated by desire, he assaults an innocent young girl and &#x2014; to conceal his guilt &#x2014; murders her mother. For these and other unholy offenses, he is apprehended and imprisoned, where he is subject to unpleasant treatment at the hands of the ecclesiastical authorities. In order to escape, he sells his soul to the devil, discovering in the aftermath the grim consequence of his horrifying acts.<br>The most famous work in the otherwise unremarkable literary production of "Monk" Lewis, the novel's anticlericalism and heavy-breathing eroticism earned it a scandalous reputation in its time that was still intact 100 years after its publication. Today, more than two centuries later, the unvarnished crime and passion of <i>The Monk</i> still retain the ability to jar readers &#x2014; even those inured to the violence and degradation of modern life. A masterpiece of Gothic storytelling, the book remains, as Samuel Taylor Coleridge noted, "rich, powerful, and fervid."</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Electrochemical Engineering Principles</h2><p>A description of the basic principles of electrochemical engineering and their application to energy storage, industrial electrolysis, and corrosion.</p><p></p><h2>Modern Engine Blueprinting Techniques: A Practical Guide to Precision Engine Building (Pro)</h2><p>Engines are built to fall within a wide set of standards and specifications, often not optimized to meet the original design. In short, cheap and fast engine production results in a sloppy final product. Of course, this is not idea for high-performance engines. To maximize the performance of any engine, it must be balanced and blueprinted to the exact tolerances that the factory should have adhered to in the first place. Four cylinder, V-8, American or import, the performance of all engines is greatly improved by balancing and blueprinting. Dedicated enthusiasts and professional racers balance and blueprint their engines because the engines will produce more horsepower and torque, more efficiently use fuel, run cooler and last longer. <p>In this book, expert engine builder and veteran author Mike Mavrigian explains and illustrates the most discriminating engine building techniques, so the engine is perfectly balanced, matched, and optimized. Balancing and blueprinting is a time consuming and exacting process, but the investment in time pays off with superior performance. Through the process, you carefully measure, adjust, machine and fit each part together with precision tolerances, optimizing the design and maximizing performance. The book covers the block, crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, cylinder heads, intake manifolds, camshaft, measuring tools and final assembly techniques. </p><p>For more than 50 years, balancing and blueprinting has been an accepted and common practice for maximizing performance. An enthusiast or professional that invests the time to precisely build an engine in this fashion will be rewarded with an engine that will run strong and last for years. This book provides an unprecedented level of detail and instruction on the process of balancing and blueprinting your engine.</p></p><p>To maximize the performance of an automotive engine, it must be balanced and blueprinted. OEM engine parts are built to certain established standards and these parts make up engines that have acceptable tolerances. Although these parts and the assembled engines are within specifications, the castings, surfaces, and parts are not necessarily true, flat, or balanced. Any engine&#x2019;s performance greatly improves through balancing and blueprinting because friction is reduced and efficiency is maximized. The blueprinting process optimizes each part and component group in an engine, and balancing achieves the ideal weight for parts. Dedicated enthusiasts and professional racers balance and blueprint their engines because they produce more horsepower and torque, use fuel more efficiently, and run cooler therefore lasting longer. <p>Mike Mavrigian, expert engine builder and veteran author, explains and illustrates all the crucial procedures for blueprinting and balancing any engine. He uses the most precise techniques according to discriminating standards, so the engine components are ideally trued, balanced, matched, and optimized. Through the process, you carefully measure, adjust, and machine each part so your engine operates as a finely honed and integrated system. He covers the block, crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, rings, cylinder heads, intake manifolds, camshaft, and more.

The translation bears the distinction of being a liturgical psalter. It differs in some points from many recent translations of the Bible. It takes the Hebrew text of the psalms as its base for translation, but because it is specifically intended for liturgical use, other cultural and historical factors have a bearing on particular formulations. The Introductions to each of the psalms in this edition have been written for anyone who might wish to cultivate a deeper spiritual understanding of this prayer-book of the Bible. No advanced technical knowledge of exegesis or historical-critical method is necessary. While these introductions do impart information culled from biblical scholarship, they seek to express those ideas in a language geared both to intellectual understanding and spiritual appreciation.An additional feature of this edition is a psalm-prayer following each of the psalms. These prayers are intended to bring the readers full circle in their experience by reiterating some of the themes and images of the particular psalm in a way that brings them into his or her current spiritual practice. This edition also provides for each Psalm a title, a name by which it might come to be known and remembered. Again, the hope is that each person who recites and prays these Psalms will eventually create a distinctive and personal title for each of these texts from the prayer-book of the Bible, reflecting his or her own appropriation of the ancient song-prayer.</p><p>Abbot Gregory Polan, OSB, is abbot of Conception Abbey, Conception, Missouri.</p><h2>Barney&#39;s Version</h2><p>Charged with comic energy and a steely disregard for any pieties whatsoever, Barney's Version is a major Richler novel, the most personal and feeling book of a long and distinguished career.<br><br>Told in the first person, it gives us the life (and what a life!) of Barney Panofsky--whose trashy TV company, Totally Useless Productions, has made him a small fortune; whose three wives include a martyred feminist icon, a quintessential JCP (Jewish-Canadian Princess), and the incomparable Miriam, the perfect wife, lover, and mother--alas, now married to another man; who recalls with nostalgia and pain his young manhood in the Paris of the early fifties, and his lifelong passion for wine, women, and the Montreal Canadiens; who either did or didn't murder his best friend, Boogie, after discovering him in bed with The Second Mrs. Panofsky; whose satirical eye for the idiocies of today's Quebec separatists (as well as for every other kind of political correctness) manages to offend his entire acquaintanceship (and will soon be offending readers everywhere); and whose memory--though not his bile--is, in his sixty-seventh year, definitely slipping . . .</p><p>Barney Panofsky smokes too many cigars, drinks too much whiskey, and is obsessed with two things: the Montreal Canadiens hockey team and his ex-wife Miriam. An acquaintance from his youthful years in Paris, Terry McIver, is about to publish his autobiography. In its pages he accuses Barney of an assortment of sins, including murder. It's time, Barney decides, to present the world with his own version of events. <i>Barney's Version</i> is his memoir, a rambling, digressive rant, full of revisions and factual errors (corrected in footnotes written by his son) and enough insults for everyone, particularly vegetarians and Quebec separatists. <p> But Barney does get around to telling his life story, a desperately funny but sad series of bungled relationships. His first wife, an artist and poet, commits suicide and becomes--� la Sylvia Plath--a feminist icon, and Barney is widely reviled for goading her toward death, if not actually murdering her. He marries the second Mrs. Panofsky, whom he calls a "Jewish-Canadian Princess," as an antidote to the first; it turns out to be a horrible mistake. The third, "Miriam, my heart's desire," is quite possibly his soul mate, but Barney botches this one, too. It's painful to watch him ruin everything, and even more painful to bear witness to his deteriorating memory. The mystery at the heart of Barney's story--did he or did he not kill his friend Boogie?--provides enough forward momentum to propel the reader through endless digressions, all three wives, and every one of Barney's nearly heartbreaking episodes of forgetfulness. <i>Barney's Version</i>, winner of Canada's 1997 Giller Prize, is Richler's 10th novel, and a dense, energetic, and ultimately poignant read. <i>--R. Ellis</i></p>"Contains not a page without its laugh and not a paragraph without its smile...Richler is the funniest novelist at present at work in the English language."<br>--Francis King, The Spectator<br><br>"Like Dr. Johnson at his insulting best, Barney at the top of his form is unsurpassed...Richler has written a Lear for our selfish, penny-pinching times, a Lear uncluttered by divided kingdoms and quarreling daughters. Even the Fool is dispensed with. Barney is his own Fool."<br>--Alberto Manguel, Sunday Times<br><br>"Moving, funny, combative...What more could Booker judges and commentators---or anybody else--want from a novel?"<br>--James Walton, Daily Telegraph<br><br>"Exuberant, melancholy, literary outpouring from Richler at his best."<br>--Judy Cooke, Mail on Sunday<br><br>"The curmudgeonly, unregenerately boozy, caustic old rogue Barney Panofsky is Mordecai Richler's inspired antidote to political correctness, yoofiness, and all forms of contemporary smugness and pedantry...Richler is magisterially in command of his material."<br>--Katy Emick, The Guardian<br><br>"The funniest book of the year, and maybe the saddest...Mordecai Richler has never written with greater voice."<br>--Tom Adair, Scotland on Sunday</p><h2>The Science of Fractal Images</h2><p>This book is based on notes for the course Fractals:lntroduction, Basics and Perspectives given by MichaelF. Barnsley, RobertL. Devaney, Heinz-Otto Peit� gen, Dietmar Saupe and Richard F. Voss. The course was chaired by Heinz-Otto Peitgen and was part of the SIGGRAPH &#39;87 (Anaheim, California) course pro� gram. Though the five chapters of this book have emerged from those courses we have tried to make this book a coherent and uniformly styled presentation as much as possible. It is the first book which discusses fractals solely from the point of view of computer graphics. Though fundamental concepts and algo� rithms are not introduced and discussed in mathematical rigor we have made a serious attempt to justify and motivate wherever it appeared to be desirable. Ba� sic algorithms are typically presented in pseudo-code or a description so close to code that a reader who is familiar with elementary computer graphics should find no problem to get started. Mandelbrot&#39;s fractal geometry provides both a description and a mathemat� ical model for many of the seemingly complex forms and patterns in nature and the sciences. Fractals have blossomed enormously in the past few years and have helped reconnect pure mathematics research with both natural sciences and computing. Computer graphics has played an essential role both in its de� velopment and rapidly growing popularity. Conversely, fractal geometry now plays an important role in the rendering, modelling and animation of natural phenomena and fantastic shapes in computer graphics.</p><p></p><h2>The Ecstasy of Communication, new edition (Semiotext(e) / Foreign Agents)</h2><p><p><b>Baudrillard's essential crib-book, lexicon, and companion piece to any and all of his books and a prescient portrait of our contemporary condition.</b></p><p>&#x201c;The need to speak, even if one has nothing to say, becomes more pressing when one has nothing to say, just as the will to live becomes more urgent when life has lost its meaning.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;from <i>The Ecstasy of Communication</i></p><p>First published in France in 1987,<i> The Ecstasy of Communication</i> was Baudrillard's summarization of his work for a postdoctoral degree at the Sorbonne: a dense, poetically crystalline essay that boiled down two decades of radical, provocative theory into an aphoristically eloquent swan song to twentieth-century alienation. Baudrillard's quixotic effort to be recognized by the French intellectual establishment may have been doomed to failure, but this text immediately became a pinnacle to his work, a mid-career assessment that looked both forward and back. By carefully distilling the most radical elements of his previous books, Baudrillard constructed the skeleton key to all of the work that was to come in the second half of his career, and set the scene for what he termed the &#x201c;obscene&#x201d;: a world in which alienation has been succeeded by ceaseless communication and information. <i>The Ecstasy of Communication</i> is a decisive, compact description of what it means to be &#x201c;wired&#x201d; in our braver-than-brave new world, where sexuality has been superseded by pornography, knowledge by information, hysteria by schizophrenia, subject by object, and violence by terror. </p><p><i>The Ecstasy of Communication</i> is an anti-manifesto that confronted and dispensed with such influences as Marshall McLuhan, Guy Debord, and Georges Bataille. It is an essential crib-book, lexicon, and companion piece to any and all of Baudrillard's books. Twenty-five years after its original publication, it remains not only a prescient portrait of our contemporary condition, but also a dark mirror into which we have not yet dared to look.</p></p><p>Jean Baudrillard (1929&#x2013;2007) was a philosopher, sociologist, cultural critic, and theorist of postmodernity who challenged all existing theories of contemporary society with humor and precision.

After vicious Anglo-Indian violence dashed those hopes, English Virginians used Christian rituals like marriage and baptism to exclude first Indians and then Africans from the privileges enjoyed by English Christians&#x2015;including freedom.</p><p>Resistance to hereditary heathenism was not uncommon, however. Enslaved people and many Anglican ministers fought against planters&#x2019; racial ideologies, setting the stage for Christian abolitionism in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Using court records, letters, and pamphlets, Goetz suggests new ways of approaching and understanding the deeply entwined relationship between Christianity and race in early America.</p></p><p><p>Christianity's role in furthering racism in early America.</p><p><b>Rebecca Anne Goetz</b> is an associate professor of history at New York University.</p></p><h2>Holt Chemistry: Problem-Solving Workbook</h2><p>New, unused book.

An essential reference for every serious reader of the Bible.<p></p><p>B &amp; W illustrations and line-art throughout.</p>In the past 30 years , there have been three major encyclopedic Bible dictionaries published in English: The Interpreter's Bible Dictionary (IBD ), the Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible , and The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia ( ISBE ). When it was published in 1962 (with a supplementary volume in 1976), the IBD represented the state of critical Biblical scholarship. The ISBE , though an extensive revision of the previous edition (1929), retained many articles from its predecessors (1915 and 1929). Because of the numerous developments in biblical scholarship during the past three decades, the editor felt (rightly) that it was time for a Bible dictionary that would represent the current state of the discipline. The Anchor Bible Dictionary ( ABD ) is the result of his vision. The ABD is both international and interconfessional, with nearly 1000 contributors from around the world representing Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, and Muslim traditions (and also those of no religious tradition). The list of contributing scholars includes names long associated with biblical and theological studies. The currency of the dictionary as a whole is reflected especially in the inclusion of such subjects as the Dead Sea Scrolls, early Jewish-Christian relations, the historical Jesus, and sociological and literary methods of biblical criticism (including feminist hermeneutics), and in numerous entries on archaeological sites. In addition, the bibliographies are usually up to date and often extensive. Unlike previous Bible dictionaries, the bibliographic entries in the ABD are complete citations, listed individually rather than in a run-on fashion, and hence easier to use. Even in such a monumental success as the ABD , there are weak spots. One might expect to find pronunciations, especially for place and personal names--which is the case with the IBD and the ISBE --but none are given here. There are few illustrations throughout. The maps are inadequate, and some of the topics are handled clumsily. Yet overall, this is a solid piece of work, well written and well edited. It will serve scholars and students because of its currency and thoroughness and lay readers because of its generally readable style. The ABD deserves a place on the shelves beside the standard Bible dictionaries of previous generations and is recommended for public, academic, and seminary libraries.<br><i>- Craig W.

In 1847, he gave up his studies and, after several aimless years, volunteered for military duty, serving as a junior officer in the Crimean War before retiring in 1857. In 1862, Tolstoy married Sophie Behrs, a marriage that was to become, for him, bitterly unhappy. His diary, started in 1847, was used for self-study and self-criticism; it served as the source from which he drew much of the material that appeared not only in his great novels <i>War and Peace </i>(1869) and <i>Anna Karenina </i>(1877), but also in his shorter works. Seeking religious justification for his life, Tolstoy evolved a new Christianity based upon his own interpretation of the Gospels. Yasnaya Polyana became a mecca for his many converts.&nbsp; At the age of eighty-two, the writer&#x2019;s health failed him in Astapovo, Russia, where he died on November 20, 1910.WELL, PRINCE, Genoa and Lucca are now no more than private estates of the Bonaparte family. No, I warn you, that if you do not tell me we are at war, if you again allow yourself to palliate all the infamies and atrocities of this Antichrist (upon my word, I believe he is), I don&#x2019;t know you in future, you are no longer my friend, no longer my faithful slave, as you say. There, how do you do, how do you do? I see I&#x2019;m scaring you, sit down and talk to me.&#x201d;<br>These words were uttered in July 1805 by Anna Pavlovna Scherer, a distinguished lady of the court, and confidential maid-of-honour to the Empress Marya Fyodorovna. It was her greeting to Prince Vassily, a man high in rank and office, who was the first to arrive at her <i>soir�e</i>. Anna Pavlovna had been coughing for the last few days; she had an attack of <i>la grippe</i>, as she said&#x2014;<i>grippe</i> was then a new word only used by a few people. In the notes she had sent round in the morning by a footman in red livery, she had written to all indiscriminately:<br>&#x201c;If you have nothing better to do, count (or prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too alarming to you, I shall be charmed to see you at my house between 7 and 10. Annette Scherer.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Heavens! what a violent outburst!&#x201d; the prince responded, not in the least disconcerted at such a reception. He was wearing an embroidered court uniform, stockings and slippers, and had stars on his breast, and a bright smile on his flat face.<br>He spoke in that elaborately choice French, in which our forefathers not only spoke but thought, and with those slow, patronising intonations peculiar to a man of importance who has grown old in court society. He went up to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting her with a view of his perfumed, shining bald head, and complacently settled himself on the sofa.<br>&#x201c;First of all, tell me how you are, dear friend. Relieve a friend&#x2019;s anxiety,&#x201d; he said, with no change of his voice and tone, in which indifference, and even irony, was perceptible through the veil of courtesy and sympathy.<br>&#x201c;How can one be well when one is in moral suffering? How can one help being worried in these times, if one has any feeling?&#x201d; said Anna Pavlovna. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll spend the whole evening with me, I hope?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And the f�te at the English ambassador&#x2019;s? To-day is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,&#x201d; said the prince. &#x201c;My daughter is coming to fetch me and take me there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I thought to-day&#x2019;s f�te had been put off. I confess that all these festivities and fireworks are beginning to pall.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If they had known that it was your wish, the f�te would have been put off,&#x201d; said the prince, from habit, like a wound-up clock, saying things he did not even wish to be believed.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tease me. Well, what has been decided in regard to the Novosiltsov dispatch? You know everything.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What is there to tell?&#x201d; said the prince in a tired, listless tone. &#x201c;What has been decided? It has been decided that Bonaparte has burnt his ships, and I think that we are about to burn ours.&#x201d;<br>Prince Vassily always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating his part in an old play. Anna Pavlovna Scherer, in spite of her forty years, was on the contrary brimming over with excitement and impulsiveness. To be enthusiastic had become her pose in society, and at times even when she had, indeed, no inclination to be so, she was enthusiastic so as not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The affected smile which played continually about Anna Pavlovna&#x2019;s face, out of keeping as it was with her faded looks, expressed a spoilt child&#x2019;s continual consciousness of a charming failing of which she had neither the wish nor the power to correct herself, which, indeed, she saw no need to correct.</p><h2>A Schoolteacher in Old Alaska: The Story of Hannah Breece</h2><p>Over fifty years ago Hannah Breece bestowed upon her great niece, Jane Jacobs, her manuscript, roughly culled together from diaries and letters from when she was a school teacher in Alaska and the Yukon.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summer of 1994, Ms. Jacobs traveled to Alaska to do the research necessary to complete her great aunt's book.<br><br>In 1904, Hannah Breece set off for Alaska, where she was sent by the American government to teach Aleuts, Dina'ina, Athabascans, and people of mixed-European and Native blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;She remained in Alaska until 1918 and in this book tells her story.&nbsp;&nbsp;Diary-like in is mingling of domestic matters, work, public events and chance encounters, Hannah Breece's narrative is spiced with litany of adventures, for she was a women who went anywhere and stood up to anybody.<br><br>What Hannah Breece could never have guessed was just how relevant her story is today, both in its study of an independent woman and in its early clues to white North America's treatment of the Native populations.&nbsp;&nbsp;In her introduction and comprehensive notes on the book, Jane Jacobs examines her great aunt's story and reveals and illuminates the mysteries behind this most unusual life.</p><p>Hannah Breece braved the Alaskan wilderness nearly a century ago to teach native children how to become Americans. A proud and fiercely independent woman, she struggled against great odds to establish federally sponsored schools in remote settlements. This is her own story of her many adventures on the Alaskan frontier. Breece compiled a draft of her experiences from her diaries and letters, but never completed the project. Before she died, she entrusted the manuscript to her great-niece Jane Jacobs, and this delightful book is the results. Jane Jacobs visited the communities her great-aunt described to fill in some of the gaps in her story. Her original research complements Hannah Breece&#39;s story to give us a vivid picture of old Alaska, of the infant settlements of Juneau, Kodiak, Seward and Fairbanks, and of the amazing woman who conquered its frozen wilderness, loved its children and, for nearly fifteen years, made it her home.Born in Pennsylvania in1859, <b>Hannah Breece</b> taught on Indian reservations in midwest America before accepting a government post to teach in Alaska.<br><br><b>Jane Jacobs</b> is the author of several books, including the <i>Death And Life of Great American Cities, Cities And The Wealth of Nations</i>, and most recently, the bestselling <i>Systems of Survival</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;She lives in Toronto.</p><h2>John Kenneth Galbraith: His Life, His Politics, His Economics</h2><p><p>John Kenneth Galbraith (1908-2006) was one of America&#x2019;s most famous economists for good reason. From his acerbic analysis of America&#x2019;s &#x201c;private wealth and public squalor&#x201d; to his denunciation of the wars in Vietnam and Iraq, Galbraith&nbsp;consistently challenged &#x201c;conventional wisdom&#x201d; (a phrase he coined). He did so as a witty commentator on America&#x2019;s political follies and as a versatile author of bestselling books&#x2014;such as <i>The Affluent Society</i> and <i>The New Industrial State</i>&#x2014;that warn of the dangers of deregulated markets, corporate greed, and inattention to the costs of our military power. Here, in the first full-length biography of Galbraith and his times, Richard Parker provides not only a nuanced portrait of this extraordinary man, but also an important reinterpretation of twentieth-century public policy and economic practices.</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever you may think of his ideas, John Kenneth Galbraith has led an extraordinary life. . . . Doing justice to this life story requires an outsize biography, one that not only tells Mr. Galbraith&#x2019;s tale but sets it on the broader canvas of America&#x2019;s political and economic evolution. And Richard Parker&#x2019;s book does just that.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Economist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Parker&#x2019;s book is more than a chronicle of Galbraith&#x2019;s life; it&#x2019;s a history of American politics and policy from FDR through George W. Bush. . . . It will make readers more economically and politically aware.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>USA</i><i> Today</i></p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;The most readable and instructive biography of the century.&#x201d;&#x2014;William F. Buckley, <i>National Review</i></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>&#x201c;The story of this man&#x2019;s life and work is wonderfully rendered in this magnum opus, and offers an antidote to the public ennui, economic cruelty, and government malfeasance that poison life in America today.&#x201d;&#x2014;James Carroll, <i>Boston</i><i> Globe</i></p></p><p>John Kenneth Galbraith has led an extraordinary life. The world's most famous living economist started teaching at Harvard when he was just 25 years old and has sold seven million copies of his four dozen books. One reviewer said Galbraith wrote "history that reads like a poem." During World War II, at age 32, he was named "tsar" of consumer-price controls in the United States, and he later advised three American presidents and served as ambassador to India. Now in his 90s, Galbraith is still active and has received 50 honorary degrees. All this was accomplished by a Canadian born in a tiny Ontario farming hamlet, whose major at an obscure agricultural college wasn't even economics but animal husbandry. Such an irony is typical of Galbraith's renowned iconoclasm, writes Richard Parker in his 820-page biography <i>John Kenneth Galbraith</i>. <p> Parker shows how Galbraith's irreverent views were shaped by the Depression, which helped turn him into a passionate advocate of Keynesian economics, the philosophy that inspired FDR's New Deal. Galbraith later became one of the architects of the expansion of federal social services after World War II. Because of his influence in successive administrations, readers get a fascinating fly-on-the-wall picture of debates and intrigue inside the White House during many of the major crises of the Cold War. Galbraith frequently played crucial behind-the-scenes roles that went beyond the duties of an economist: advising President Kennedy during the Cuba missile crisis, helping Lyndon Johnson write his first speech after Kennedy was assassinated, and opposing the Vietnam War, which became his most passionate cause. He later criticized the dismantling of government programs under Ronald Reagan and seemed to love clashing with conservative economists. Parker managed to sift through a mountain of material from Galbraith's long and lively years to distill an engaging narrative that, like Galbraith's own books, is easily accessible to non-economists. <i>--Alex Roslin</i></p><p><b>Richard Parker</b> is an Oxford-trained economist and senior fellow of the Shorenstein Center at Harvard&#x2019;s John F.

Worship of entrepreneurial freedom has complicated the task of distinguishing aggressive salesmanship from unacceptable deceit, especially on the frontiers of innovation. At the same time, competitive pressures have often nudged respectable firms to embrace deception. As a result, fraud has been a key feature of American business since its beginnings. In this sweeping narrative, Edward Balleisen traces the history of fraud in America&#x2015;and the evolving efforts to combat it&#x2015;from the age of P. T. Barnum through the eras of Charles Ponzi and Bernie Madoff.</p><br><p>Starting with an early nineteenth-century American legal world of "buyer beware," this unprecedented account describes the slow, piecemeal construction of modern regulatory institutions to protect consumers and investors, from the Gilded Age through the New Deal and the Great Society. It concludes with the more recent era of deregulation, which has brought with it a spate of costly frauds, including the savings and loan crisis, corporate accounting scandals, and the recent mortgage-marketing debacle.</p><br><p>By tracing how Americans have struggled to foster a vibrant economy without enabling a corrosive level of fraud, this book reminds us that American capitalism rests on an uneasy foundation of social trust.</p></p><p><p>"Not only is <i>Fraud</i> a careful and thoughtful exploration of the complicated relationship between business, the market, and policy. It is also a thought-provoking and engaging book."<b>--Dan Ariely, author of <i>Predictably Irrational</i></b></p><p>"In the end, capitalism is always a confidence game, so the problem of fraud is always with us. But the occurrence, perception, and regulation of fraud has a history, and Balleisen has now written the definitive account of it. A deeply researched and beautifully crafted book that follows the shape-shifting problem of deceit across the centuries, <i>Fraud</i> is nothing short of a new history of American capitalism."<b>--Jon Levy, University of Chicago</b></p><p>"A huge achievement. This will be the authoritative history of fraud in the United States for many years to come. Edward Balleisen takes us on a fascinating and entertaining tour of the many ways that swindlers have consistently shadowed America's proudest innovations, sometimes even outdoing the originals for ingenuity and impact."<b>--Walter A. Friedman, Harvard Business School</b></p><p>"Often vivid and always thoughtful, this is a very important and impressive work by a rigorous, venturesome historian at the top of his game. When so much public debate about regulation is polemical and hyperbolic, Edward Balleisen has made a major contribution by writing a book that thoroughly, comprehensively, even-handedly, and engagingly examines the history of American fraud and its regulation from the early nineteenth century to today."<b>--Daniel R.

Templated chapters for eleven of these common conditions apply foundational science to massage practice and move the student from understanding each condition to assessing and working with the client. Each chapter ends with a Professional Growth section, which encourages further exploration and critical thinking.<br>More and more consumers of massage therapy are using it to address specific complaints. With the possibility of massage therapy being covered by insurance, therapists who can assess signs and symptoms and plan treatment goals will have an advantage in the market. But not all schools want to teach clinical Massage. Condition-Specific Massage Therapy offers an entr�e into specific treatment without being heavily clinical. Written in simple language, CSMT provides the critical thinking tools students need to assess and address common conditions using the hands-on skills they already have, regardless of modality.<br></p><p></p><h2>A Fellowship of Valor: The Battle History of the United States Marines</h2><p>"An illustrated combat history of the US Marines, covering two centuries of battles in the air and on land and sea, from Suribachi to Somalia.

In seventeenth and eighteenth century Syria and Palestine, Muslim legal thinkers gave considerable attention to women's roles in society, and Tucker shows how <i>fatwa</i>s, or legal opinions, greatly influenced these roles. She challenges prevailing views on Islam and gender, revealing Islamic law to have been more fluid and flexible than previously thought. Although the legal system had a consistent patriarchal orientation, it was modulated by sensitivities to the practical needs of women, men, and children. In her comprehensive overview of a field long neglected by scholars, Tucker deepens our understanding of how societies, including our own, construct gender roles.</p><p>"An original, valuable, and important study. . . .

She works methodically and creatively to demonstrate how two theoretical constructs--self psychology and object relations--can be integrated to create an effective conjoint treatment of marital pathology. Throughout, the author's distinctive voice, both scholarly and passionate, galvanizes the discussion.<br>The opening chapters present well-rounded examinations of the narcissistic personality disorder and the borderline syndrome, incorporating the ideas of Kohut, Grotstein, Klein, Bion, and others. Once this foundation is laid, the narcissistic/borderline dyadic unit comes into focus and the metaphor of the "dance" is introduced to represent the complexity and momentum of the couple's behavioral patterns.<br>Psychodynamics and their qualitative differences in the two disorders come to the fore next, followed by consideration of dynamic positions and transference formations, including the various counter-transferential issues evoked in the therapist. Dr. Lachkar then turns her attention to the theoretical implications and techniques used in therapy, and to concepts from group psychology that hold the Promise of expanding our view of the primitive aspects of the narcissistic/borderline couple.<br>Finally, the two closing chapters offer a six-point systematic treatment procedure and case material that gives even greater dimension to the understanding of the narcissistic/borderline couple.<br>Honest and illuminating--and refreshingly idiosyncratic--this volume will stimulate the thinking and practice of all therapists who work with marital discord.</p><p></p><h2>Anatomy &amp; Physiology: Foundations for the Health Professions</h2><p>A Balanced Approach to anatomy and physiology with the most robust digital resource in Connect Plus and a full-color workbook.</p><p>Deborah Roiger has taught for 12 years in the Minnesota State Colleges and University (MNSCU) system of 32 state-sponsored technical colleges, community colleges, and universities.

Though it is written as a textbook, it will also be of interest to more advanced scientists as a wide-ranging synthesis of our present understanding of ocean biogeochemical processes.</p><br><p> The first two chapters of the book provide an introductory overview of biogeochemical and physical oceanography. The next four chapters concentrate on processes at the air-sea interface, the production of organic matter in the upper ocean, the remineralization of organic matter in the water column, and the processing of organic matter in the sediments. The focus of these chapters is on analyzing the cycles of organic carbon, oxygen, and nutrients.</p><br><p> The next three chapters round out the authors' coverage of ocean biogeochemical cycles with discussions of silica, dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity, and CaCO3. The final chapter discusses applications of ocean biogeochemistry to our understanding of the role of the ocean carbon cycle in interannual to decadal variability, paleoclimatology, and the anthropogenic carbon budget. The problem sets included at the end of each chapter encourage students to ask critical questions in this exciting new field. While much of the approach is mathematical, the math is at a level that should be accessible to students with a year or two of college level mathematics and/or physics.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Ocean Biogeochemical Dynamics</i> is an outstanding text for student and professional alike. The authors have developed an exceptionally lucid yet detailed discussion of the major biogeochemical cycles in the oceans, culminating in a quantitative examination of climate change and the contemporary carbon cycle. The book is a tour de force that should be incorporated into all marine chemistry and biogeochemistry courses."<b>--Paul Falkowski, Rutgers University</b></p><p>"Global ocean research projects during the past two decades have resulted in explosive growth in our knowledge of ocean biogeochemistry. Sarmiento and Gruber's book crystallizes this knowledge into a systematic quantitative treatise. For many years to come, this observation--and equation-filled volume will serve as a window into the literature on many subjects, a textbook for our classes, and a reference book on our desks. Studied carefully, it could teach chemical, biological, and physical oceanographers to speak a common language."<b>--Edward A. Boyle, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b></p><p>"With this book, ocean biogeochemistry--the fascinating science behind the cycling of elements in the sea, and their transformation by biological, chemical, and physical properties--has finally found its theoretical underpinning. The two authors, both world experts, have succeeded in bringing together in a comprehensive and unified way the mass of information from the different scientific disciplines as well as the numerous observations obtained over the last few decades. This book will serve as the ultimate reference, both for students and the advanced research scientist, for many years to come."<b>--Martin Heimann, Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry</b></p><p>"The Sarmiento and Gruber text is a very impressive achievement, providing a readable yet advanced treatise on ocean biogeochemistry and providing the best available summary of the advances of the last few decades. The emphasis on dynamics is highly relevant for studies of global change, while the emphasis on problem solving has yielded an invaluable teaching reference."<b>--Ralph Keeling, Scripps Institution of Oceanography</b></p><p>Sarmiento and Gruber have cleverly found the middle ground between the "educated layman" approach so often typified in "soft sciences" and the stultifying rigor that cloaks the conceptual simplicity underlying many of the foundations of the field. They don't shy away from mathematical explanations but rather use them to make their points succinctly, and to clarify what is often a confused muddle in more basic texts."<b>--W.J.

Frustrated by her loveless state and stifled by her moralistic family, for years she has been escaping into an imaginary life in her Blue Castle in Spain. Then unexpected news shocks her into asserting her independence and striking out against society&#x2019;s conventions. Her old fantasies seem irrelevant now - but dreams of the Blue Castle are not forgotten as she refocuses her energies on living her life on her own terms. Lucy Maud Montgomery has created a wonderfully sympathetic heroine in Valancy, engaging the reader fully in her trials and triumphs. A great love of the Canadian wilderness comes pouring out in beautifully evocative prose accompanied with sharp observation of the personalities and attitudes of her characters and the society they inhabit.</p><p>At twenty-nine Valancy had never been in love, and it seemed romance had passed her by. Living with her overbearing mother and meddlesome aunt, she found her only consolations in the &#34;forbidden&#34; books of John Foster and her daydreams of the Blue Castle. Then a letter arrived from Dr. Trent -- and Valancy decided to throw caution to the winds. For the first time in her life Valancy did and said exactly what she wanted. Soon she discovered a surprising new world, full of love and adventures far beyond her most secret dreams.Lucy Maud Montgomery CBE, (always called "Maud" by family and friends) and publicly known as L. M. Montgomery, (November 30, 1874&#x2013;April 24, 1942) was a Canadian author, best known for a series of novels beginning with Anne of Green Gables, published in 1908. Once published, Anne of Green Gables was an immediate success. The central character, Anne, an orphaned girl, made Montgomery famous in her lifetime and gave her an international following. The first novel was followed by a series of sequels with Anne as the central character. The novels became the basis for the highly acclaimed 1985 CBC television miniseries, Anne of Green Gables and several other television movies and programs, including Road to Avonlea, which ran in Canada and the U.S. from 1990-1996.</p><h2>Essential Foundations of Economics</h2><p><p> <b>NOTE</b>: This edition features the same content as the traditional text in a convenient, three-hole-punched, loose-leaf version.&nbsp;Student Value Editions&nbsp;also offer a great value; this format costs significantly less than a new textbook.

During this living resurrection, they experienced a transformative spiritual awakening that revealed the nature of reality and the purpose of the soul, described as &#x201c;rising from the dead.&#x201d; <br> <br>Exploring the practice of living resurrection in ancient Egyptian, Phoenician, Greek, Persian, Indian, Japanese, Chinese, Celtic, and Native American traditions, Freddy Silva explains how resurrection was never meant for the dead, but for the living--a fact supported by the suppressed Gnostic Gospel of Philip: &#x201c;Those who say they will die first and then rise are in error. If they do not first receive the resurrection while they live, when they die they will receive nothing.&#x201d; He reveals how these practices were not only common in the ancient world but also shared similar facets in each tradition: initiates were led through a series of challenging ordeals, retreated for a three-day period into a cave or restricted room, often called a &#x201c;bridal chamber,&#x201d; and while out-of-body, became fully conscious of travels in the Otherworld. Upon returning to the body, they were led by priests or priestesses to witness the rising of Sirius or the Equinox sunrise. <br> <br>Silva describes some of the secret chambers around the world where the ritual was performed, including the so-called tomb of Thutmosis III in Egypt, which featured an empty sarcophagus and detailed instructions for the living on how to enter the Otherworld and return alive. He reveals why esoteric and Gnostic sects claimed that the literal resurrection of Jesus promoted by the Church was a fraud and how the Church branded all living resurrection practices as a heresy, relentlessly persecuting the Gnostics to suppress knowledge of this self-empowering experience. He shows how the Knights Templar revived these concepts and how they survive to this day within Freemasonry. <br> <br>Exploring the hidden art of living resurrection, Silva shows how this personal experience of the Divine opened the path to self-empowerment and higher consciousness, leading initiates such as Plato to describe it as the pinnacle of spiritual development.</p><p>Freddy Silva is a leading researcher of alternative history, ancient knowledge, sacred sites, and the interaction between temples and consciousness. He has appeared on Discovery Channel, BBC, and Coast to Coast AM radio. He is the author of 5 books and lives in Portland, Maine.<b>What Is Initiation? <br></b> <br>There is a familiar tenet throughout shamanism and the spiritual traditions of aboriginal cultures: that an altered state of consciousness facilitates a mystical experience capable of imparting special knowledge. In fact it is one of the oldest shared beliefs among esoteric sects such as the Druids of Gaul, the Chaldeans of Syria, the Samaneans of Cactria, the Magi of Persia, and the Gymnosophists of India, all of whom devoted themselves to out-of-body exploration with the aim of achieving personal illumination through spiritual resurrection. And the way neophytes experienced it was via a rigorous art called initiation. <br> <br>Initiation into the Mysteries was a privilege open to a select few but not necessarily restricted to a social elite. Only a handful made it past the gates of the temple because few applicants were up to the task. To quote Pythagoras when turning enthusiasts away from his own academy at Croton, &#x201c;not every kind of wood is fit to be carved into the likeness of Mercury&#x201d;--Mercury being the Roman regeneration of Djehuti, the Egyptian god who guides souls to the Otherworld.<b> <br></b> <br>Those who did make the grade first underwent a period of observation; the early Christian author Tertullian describes a period of probation lasting up to four years, essentially to gauge the candidates&#x2019; level of<b> </b>trustworthiness and responsibility. During this period they were given <br>general instructions and taught great truths hidden within obscure parables. Upon successfully completing the trial period, candidates were admitted into an inner group, and initiation into the fuller Mysteries ensued.<b> <br></b> <br>Initiation means &#x201c;to become conscious.&#x201d; It is a technique that serves to guide higher, more penetrating frequencies into the body, which is believed to operate at one of the densest vibrations in nature. Because out-of-body experiences can be dangerous, only those with a firm grasp of the body&#x2019;s electrical field were admitted into the process. Instruction was often conducted from temple to temple and performed in stages to prevent the body&#x2019;s nerve centers and electrical circuits from burning out, each step slowly raising the vibration of the individual. Seekers learned to still their habits, condition the minds, and practice directing the body&#x2019;s life energy consciously; they were also required to develop greater resistance to physical impulses, particularly the control of emotion.<b> <br> <br></b>Increasing degrees of initiation tested the candidates&#x2019; mettle in the face of fear, revealing the weaker participants&#x2019; desire to continue and thus thinning out their number once more. Mechanical means were employed to simulate experiences that mimicked the candidates&#x2019; eventual out-of-body experience. Those who passed such ordeals congratulated themselves on advancing toward the higher degrees of the Mysteries, only to be faced yet again with new forms of psychological preparation.<b> <br></b> <br>Once the candidate mastered these prerequisites--along with a number of unspecified procedures--the final stage in the process entailed a lengthy stay inside a sensory-deprived environment. According to classical historians such as Plutarch and Strabo, these places came in many forms: pyramids, pagodas, labyrinths, temples, caves, subterranean passages and chambers, vaulted rooms, spacious galleries, and secret rooms. <br> <br>Sometimes initiation took place inside a structure atop a type of mound surrounded by water, such as the island-temple of Philae, where the sacred marriage between Osiris--the resurrected god-man of<b> </b>Egypt--and his bride Isis was ritually performed by initiates in public, <br>followed by a secret segment conducted privately in subterranean chambers that covered much of the original island. The event typically took place on the last night of the waning moon, beginning at sunset, continuing all night until sunrise.<b> <br> <br></b>At this stage of initiation, candidates were temporarily guided step-by- step into a trance state, asleep yet paradoxically awake, as the soul temporarily disengaged from the body and became aware of itself in the Otherworld. Most ancient writers agree that the final act of initiation--the shamanic journey--began with an initial descent into a kind of hell or underworld before finally reaching paradise. Under guided supervision from a hierophant or wisdom keeper, the soul encountered supernatural creatures yet learned to overcome its natural impulse of revulsion or fear in order to arrive at that ultimate, sublime stage. The Macedonian compiler Stobaeus left us a record of his own experience.<b> <br> <br></b><i>The mind is affected and agitated in death just as it is in initiation into the Grand Mysteries. The first stage is nothing but uncertainties, labourings, wanderings and darkness. And now, arrived on the verge of death and initiation, everything wears a dreadful aspect; it is all horrors, trembling and affrightement. But this scene once over, a miraculous and divine light displays itself . . . perfect and initiated they are free, crowned, triumphant, they walk in the regions of the blessed.(1) <br> <br></i>The fourth-century Greek philosopher Themistius depicts the candidate encountering trepidation and uncertainty at first, but upon being conducted by a priest, proceeds in tranquillity. <br><i> <br>Entering now into the mystic dome, he is filled with horror and amazement. He is seized with solicitude and total perplexity. He is unable to move a step forward: and he is at a loss to find the entrance to that void, which is to lead him to the place he aspires to.

What do we want students to understand and be able to do? What enduring knowledge is worth understanding? How will we know that students truly understand and can apply knowledge in a meaningful way? How can we design our courses and units to emphasize understanding and &#34;uncoverage&#34; rather than &#34;coverage&#34;? Understanding by Design explores these questions and provides practical solutions for the teacher-designer. The book opens by analyzing the logic of backward design as an alternative to coverage and activity-oriented plans. Though backward from habit, this approach brings more focus and coherence to instruction. The text proposes a multifaceted approach, with the six &#34;facets&#34; of understanding. The facets combine with backward design to provide a powerful, practical framework for designing curriculum, assessment, and instruction.</p><p></p><h2>Bertolt Brecht Short Stories 1921-1946</h2><p>A collection of stories exploring political and social conditions is accompanied by a brief portrait of the life of the distinguished German author</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Marsden Hartley and the West: The Search for an American Modernism</h2><p><p><b>A revelatory look at Hartley&#x2019;s&nbsp;New Mexico&nbsp;landscapes and the darker side of postwar American modernism</b><br><br> Considered to be among the greatest&nbsp;early American modernists, the painter Marsden Hartley (1877&#x2013;1943) traveled the United States and Europe in his search for a distinctive American aesthetic. His stay in New Mexico resulted in an extraordinary series of landscape paintings&#x2014;created in New Mexico, New York, and Europe between 1918 and 1924&#x2014;that show an evolution in style and thinking that is important for understanding both Hartley&#x2019;s oeuvre and American modernism in the postwar years.&nbsp;<i>Marsden Hartley and the West</i> examines this pivotal stage of the painter&#x2019;s career, drawing upon his writings and providing illustrations of rarely seen and previously unpublished works. The author considers Hartley&#x2019;s involvement with the Stieglitz circle and its &#x201c;soil-and-spirit&#x201d; philosophy, the Taos art colony, New York Dada, and the impact of historical events such as World War I. Within this setting she analyzes the pastels and oil paintings that suggest Hartley&#x2019;s increasingly ambivalent response to the land. Beginning with optimistic, naturalistic views, the New Mexico works grew progressively darker and more tumultuous, increasingly reflecting a sense of loss brought on by war. The paintings become a site where the landscapes of memory, self, and nation merge, while reflecting broader modernist debates about &#x201c;American-ness&#x201d; and a usable past.</p></p><p><p><b>Heather Hole</b> is assistant curator at the Georgia O&#x2019;Keeffe Museum. <b>Barbara Buhler Lynes</b> is curator at the Georgia O&#x2019;Keeffe Museum and the Emily Fisher Landau Director of the Georgia O&#x2019;Keeffe Museum Research Center.

The essays were written during a difficult time in Twain&#39;s life; he was deep in debt and had lost his wife and one of his daughters. The book consists of a series of short stories, many of which deal with God and Christianity. The title story consists of letters written by the archangel Satan to archangels, Gabriel and Michael,about his observations on the curious proceedings of earthly life and the nature of man&#39;s religions. Other short stories in the book include a bedtime story about a family of cats Twain wrote for his daughters, and an essay explaining why an anaconda is morally superior to Man.</p><p>If you&#39;re already familiar with Finn and Sawyer, perhaps this collection of fragments, short stories, and essays--assembled posthumously some few decades ago now, but still fresh--will enhance your sense of Twain&#39;s true range. A particular favorite: his essay &#34;The Damned Human Race,&#34; wherein he proves, rather convincingly, that an anaconda snake is a higher form of life than an English Earl.&#34;It&#39;s easy to imagine Samuel Clemens (aka Mark Twain) and Carl Reiner as best of friends, had not the one died 10 years before the other was born. Twain would have enjoyed Reiner&#39;s work in &#34;Your Show of Shows,&#34; &#34;The 2000 Year Old Man,&#34; and &#34;The Dick Van Dyke Show,&#34; just as Reiner clearly appreciates Twain&#39;s humor.&#34; Audiofile</p><h2>Announcing the Reign of God: Evangelization and the Subversive Memory of Jesus</h2><p>This book offers a program for Christian evangelism based on the teachings of Jesus in Matthew, Mark, and Luke. This is a superb resource volume for those wishing to test the soundness of their understanding and practice of Christian evangelism. It is solidly grounded in the ministry of Jesus and illumined by testimonial statements and experiences drawn from a cosmopolitan variety of witnesses. . . [Arias&#39;s] key contribution is the rehabilitation of the Kingdom of God as the controlling perspective for the proclamation of the gospel in word and deed. In a style helpful to scholar and nonscholar, he combs biblical sources, especially the Synoptic Gospels, in search of Jesus&#39; own practice. The hermeneutical outlook is clearly dictated by Arias&#39;s own battle-tested experience in Bolivia, where he was bishop of the Methodist Church and where he underwent imprisonment as a consequence of his evangelistic practice. After reading this book, dichotomies are inexcusable: - proclamation or social responsibility - intra-church or extra-church evangelization - the conversion of individuals or conversion of communities. [This book] should become at least a minor classic. --Jorge Lara-Braud, Theology Today Chapter titles: The Good News of the Kingdom The Presence of the Kingdom The Imminence of the Kingdom The In-Breaking of the Kingdom The Eclipse of the Kingdom Announcing the Kingdom as Gift Announcing the Kingdom as Hope Announcing the Kingdom as Challenge End of the Eclipse?

By examining the causes of the formation and expansion of these two empires, the authors identify similar patterns and processes underlying their rise and decline. They demonstrate that in both examples among the critical elements in the transition from marginal people to imperial power to disintegrating society were changes in traditional religion, including the elaboration of Aztec human sacrifice and Inca worship of the corpses of their kings. The authors show that the complex interaction between such ideological shifts and political and economic factors generated the spectacular historical trajectories of these Pre-Colombian empires.</p><p>A provocative, comparative study of the formation and expansion of the Aztec and Inca empires.

During the session, quite unexpectedly, Sam saw a vision of the girl's spirit, who told him everything was okay, she was at peace now.

Thus the hand of Emily, the only child and heiress of the vastly wealthy Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite, is eagerly pursued by Europe's "princes and potentates." Their hopes are quickly dashed, however; Emily's heart is pledged to her impecunious cousin George.<br>A fairy tale? Not in the least! As even his love-blinded cousin knows too well, George is no humble or virtuous knight. Except for his attachment to her, he knows little but carousing with his unsavory cronies, evading his creditors and betting his last &#x2014; borrowed &#x2014; shillings at the races. Sir Harry, who in the main naturally opposes the match, has yet one powerful incentive to support it: after his demise, George will become Sir George, and the cousins' marriage would maintain the centuries-old tie between the title and the family estates. Sir Harry is in a quandary, and meanwhile the virtuous Emily is bent on reforming her scapegrace cousin. Then unwelcome news arrives, further complications ensue, and the once complacent Hotspurs are forever wrenched from their placid existence.<br>Anthony Trollope (1815&#x2013;1882), best known for his panoramic studies of Victorian society, could also be a keen, uncompromising psychologist. In 1868 he laid aside his famous Palliser series of novels, then in progress, and conceived a brief, poignant tale that would thoroughly explore the minds, hearts, and intertwined fates of just a few characters. The result was the present novel, one that treads familiar pathways of love and parental opposition but insistently avoids trite resolutions, probes deep, and is totally uncloying in its pathos.<br>As we read this compelling story &#x2014; here in its first inexpensive edition in many years &#x2014; we rediscover, as the best Victorian literary artist knew, how character is destiny &#x2014; and at the same time how an individual destiny is as unpredictable as life itself. No Trollope fan or lover of quality fiction should miss this unjustly neglected Trollope gem.</p><p>Anthony Trollope (24 April 1815 &#x2013; 6 December 1882) was one of the most successful, prolific and respected English novelists of the Victorian era. Among his best-loved works is a series of novels collectively known as the Chronicles of Barsetshire, which revolves around the imaginary county of Barsetshire.

To his brusque, practical father, the boy is an enigma and a disappointment. Then one day, Ken's life is filled with new purpose when he finds Flicka, a magnificent filly as wild as she is fast. Though the strong bond between boy and horse only fuels his father's disdain, Ken's growing love for his friend Flicka is changing him -- leading a once-aimless young man down the path to responsible adulthood, forging a new respect and understanding between father and son, and inspiring a fierce loyalty that nearly costs Ken his life.</p></p><p><p>Mary O&#x2019;Hara was born on July 10, 1885, in Cape May Point, New Jersey. She was a screenwriter during the silent film era and wrote several novels, including the range country trilogy <em>My Friend Flicka, Thunderhead,</em> and <em>Green Grass of Wyoming</em>. She also authored a novella, <em>The Catch Colt</em>, and <em>Wyoming Summer</em>, based on her diary of sixteen years. She died on October 14, 1980.</p>This classic story about a boy and his horse still stands strong. It's more an inspiring account of growing up and gaining self-assurance than it is a horse story. Wells is a surprising choice for narrating this book. His voice is urban and sophisticated, with no hint of soft edges that might be more suitable for a novel set in a simpler time in the American West. Fortunately, Wells deftly handles the life lessons discovered by 9-year-old Ken. Through Wells's voice we sense the vast gap between Ken's gentle mother and his demanding father, and what each parent brings to the son.

In <i>Tapestry in the Renaissance: Art and Magnificence</i>, Thomas P. Campbell and other scholarly contributors survey the elaborate woven hangings produced primarily by Flemish workshops for the palaces and cathedrals of Italy and Northern Europe. The authors discuss the designers' careers, patrons' motives, symbolic meanings of the imagery, and stylistic features unique to the labor-intensive medium. Initially, the need to lessen skilled weavers' workloads led designers to arrange elaborately costumed figures in manageable rows. Raphael's cartoons (full-size drawings) for the monumental "Acts of the Apostles" tapestries, commissioned by Pope Leo X, moved the art form into a new era. Flemish designers incorporated Raphael's spatially persuasive treatment of the figure into sophisticated narratives full of anecdotal detail. The 250 color photographs, specially commissioned for this catalog for an exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum in spring 2002, vividly illuminate the technical brilliance of these works. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i>This exquisite book is the catalogue for an exhibition to be held at The Metropolitan Museum of Art from March 14 to June 19, 2002.</p><h2>The Letter to Titus: A New Translation with Notes and Commentary and An Introduction to Titus, I and II Timothy, The Pastoral Epistles (The Anchor Bible, Vol. 35)</h2><p><i>The Letter to Titus</i>, one of the three "Pastoral Epistles" of the New Testament, has over the last twenty years become the ground of intense controversy-theologically, sociologically, even politically.&nbsp;&nbsp;For this letter (like its companions, I and II Timothy) dates to a time when the Apostles are gone and a new church leadership is evolving.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Titus we read instruction that is of continuing importance to the Christian faithful, touching on issues that are with us yet--leadership in the Church and qualifications for authority; propriety of worship; the roles of women; the demands of the Christian ethic upon individuals; the relationship of the new followers of Christ with their Jewish contemporaries.<br><br>Monsignor Quinn guides us ably through the shoals of contemporary controversy among scholars, dealing definitively with issues of authorship, place of origin, original audience, and the purpose of the Pastorals.&nbsp;&nbsp;More than this, he sets before us his integrated vision of these letters as the earliest anthology on the subject of pastoral leadership.&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowning achievement of a lifetime of admirable work in biblical studies, these translations and commentaries will stand as Quinn's monument for generations to come.</p><p><p>JEROME D. QUINN, who died in the final stages of the preparation of this book, had a long and fruitful life in biblical scholarship. Since 1961, he was Professor of Old and New Testament and the Hebrew Language at St. Paul Seminary in Minnesota, after he had received his degree from the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome. He was a past president of the Catholic Biblical Association and one of the editors of <i>The</i> <i>Catholic Biblical Quarterly</i>. Monsignor Quinn was active in ecumenical affairs, particularly the Lutheran-Catholic dialogue. His lifelong area of study and writing was the Pastoral Epistles of Paul, of which Titus is the capstone.</p></p><h2>Smoking Typewriters: The Sixties Underground Press and the Rise of Alternative Media in America</h2><p>How did the New Left uprising of the 1960s happen? What caused millions of young people-many of them affluent and college educated-to suddenly decide that American society needed to be completely overhauled? <br><br>In <em>Smoking Typewriters</em>, historian John McMillian shows that one answer to these questions can be found in the emergence of a dynamic underground press in the 1960s. Following the lead of papers like the <em>Los Angeles Free Press,</em> the <em>East Village Other</em>, and the <em>Berkeley Barb</em>, young people across the country launched hundreds of mimeographed pamphlets and flyers, small press magazines, and underground newspapers. New, cheaper printing technologies democratized the publishing process and by the decade's end the combined circulation of underground papers stretched into the millions. Though not technically illegal, these papers were often genuinely subversive, and many of those who produced and sold them-on street-corners, at poetry readings, gallery openings, and coffeehouses-became targets of harassment from local and federal authorities. With writers who actively participated in the events they described, underground newspapers captured the zeitgeist of the '60s, speaking directly to their readers, and reflecting and magnifying the spirit of cultural and political protest. McMillian pays special attention to the ways underground newspapers fostered a sense of community and played a vital role in shaping the New Left's highly democratic "movement culture."<br><br>Deeply researched and eloquently written, <em>Smoking Typewriters</em> captures all the youthful idealism and vibrant tumult of the 1960s as it delivers a brilliant reappraisal of the origins and development of the New Left rebellion.<br></p><p><br><strong>John McMillian</strong> is Assistant Professor of History at Georgia State University. He is the author of <em>Beatles vs. Stones</em> and the co-editor of <em>The Radical Reader: A Documentary History of an American Radical Tradition</em>, <em>The New Left Revisited</em>, <em>Protest Nation: The Radical Roots of Modern America</em>, and <em>The</em> <em>Sixties: A Journal of History, Politics and Culture</em>. He lives in Atlanta, Georgia.<br><br>"Writing with energy and humor, McMillian introduces a large cast of characters, with plenty of heroes, villains, tragic figures, and con men. On a larger scale, he portrays the hundreds of papers blooming in cities and on campuses across the country as laboratories in which activists sought to work out the precise meaning of the New Left ideal of participatory democracy."--<em>American Studies</em><p></p><br>"A lucid new work by a promising young media historian, Georgia State University's John McMillan....Suitable for scholars, graduate students, and aging hippies everywhere."--<em>Journalism History</em><p></p><br>"The story that John McMillian tells in <em>Smoking Typewriters</em> and the lessons he implies are at once admonitory and inspirational; this is a work of serious scholarship that suggests both a call to resurgent action and a demand that people do better next time."--Roz Kaveney, <em>Times Literary</em> <em>Supplement</em><p></p><br>"Exploring the variety of cultures that produced the papers as well as documenting how the papers reshaped their communities as they connected young people across the country, McMillian offers fascinating portraits of many colorful characters while also developing a temporal narrative tracing the rise and fall of the newspapers and the youth movement they chronicled....Those who teach the sixties, protest history, or journalism history are indebted to McMillian for providing a readable chronicle of this critical moment when words fired minds and were, themselves, a form of action."--<em>H-Net</em> <em>Reviews</em><p></p><br>"Readable, richly detailed study of the hundreds of anti-establishment 1960s newspapers....A welcome book on the '60s--a nostalgia trip for those who were there and a vivid work of history for anyone curious about the journalism that jolted a decade."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em>, starred review<p></p><br>"This tour d'horizon of the 60s underground press is a tour de force....[A] compact, sharply-etched, and well-informed recollection of the rebellious young journalists whose voices and views breached the high walls of Mainstream Media long before the current Internet-savvy generation rushed in to finish off to what remains of Conventional-Wisdom-based reporting.

While telling his story, much of it both exciting and tragic, John McMillian confronts crucial issues-questions about objectivity and democratic activism-with verve and insight."--Kevin Mattson, author of <em>"What the Heck are You Up To, Mr. President?"</em><p></p><br>"John McMillian's meticulous scholarship delves into the rambunctious, chaotic world of the counterculture weeklies that sprang up around the country, and mostly imploded, in the era of Vietnam, rock, psychedelics and pot. <em>Smoking Typewriters</em> (the witty title was a gift from Allen Ginsberg) explores the ambitions and private demons of several leading figures in the alternative press, notably Ray Mungo, Marshall Bloom, and Tom Forcade. The author parses - no easy task--the dizzily fractured political and sexual rebellions promoted by the founders, writers and cartoonists of the cheaply produced, offset, raggedy papers that thumbed a collective nose at The Establishment as they grooved on their beleaguered 'underground' status. I think he gets it right.

He conjures up the radical style, the exuberant mood, and the bravado--no mean feat given the fact that he wasn't there to live it himself.

As the cascading revolts in the Muslim world demonstrate, communication systems matter....<em>Smoking Typewriters</em> is as much a history of the '60s as it is of the era's 'alternative media,' a phrase we hear a lot these days (if you replace 'alternative' with 'independent'). It often seems like there is nothing new to learn about the '60s, but McMillian provides a fresh history by putting the role of media at the center. He helps us better understand the decade by providing a window into the institutions this anti-institutional generation built."--<em>In These Times</em><p></p><br>"[An] amply researched, intelligent and admirably even-handed chronicle....McMillian, much to his credit, never falls off the cliff in his general admiration for the radicals; he's careful to point out that people on either side of the aisle might see events differently without being exactly wrong or right. Also, he points out that underground leaders weren't without biases of their own....[A] valuable book that connects the dots from then to now, from underground to alternative to blogosphere, filling in an important part of America's cultural history along the way."--<em>Free Times</em> (Columbus, SC)<p></p><br>"There have been at least a gazillion histories written of the 1960s, but John McMillian's latest, <em>Smoking Typewriters</em>...is one of the best.

As Kuentzel investigates the shift of global antisemitism from Nazi Germany to parts of the Arab world during and after World War II, he argues that antisemitism is not merely a supplementary feature of modern jihadism, but lies instead at its ideological core. This fascinating study lays bare the antecedents of the antisemitism that runs rampant in our world today.<br> <br> For anyone interested in exploring the mindset of hatred that led to the crimes in New York and Washington on September 11th, 2001, this book is a must-read. For readers interested in the history of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, this book is a challenge to think outside of a narrowly European context. For everyone, this book provides crucial insight into the roots of terror that continue to threaten all of us.<br> <br> 2007 London Book Festival - Grand Prize Winner.<br>Independent Publisher Book Awards - Gold Medal.</p><p>Matthias Kuentzel, born in 1955, is a political scientist in Hamburg, Germany. He has served as senior advisor for the German Green Party caucus in the <i>Bundestag</i>, and is currently a Research Associate at the Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem as well as a member of the Board of Directors of Scholars for Peace in the Middle East. Kuentzel's essays about Islamism and Antisemitism have been published in <i>The New Republic</i>, <i>Policy Review</i>, <i>The Weekly Standard</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, and <i>Telos</i>, and they have been translated into ten languages."Kuentzel's method is a dialectical masterpiece; he is a social scientist who pursues connections. The suicide attacks of the intifada in Israel are, for Kuentzel, inherently linked to the attacks in America on September 11. That explains his remedy for fighting anti-Semitism: 'Whoever does not want to combat anti-Semitism . . . hasn't the slightest chance of beating Islamism.' Kuentzel is in many ways the modern successor to Paul Merker, a rare voice in Germany, who, like Merker's view of Arab princes as embodying 'reactionary interests,' shifts the terms of the discussion to anti-Jewish ideology as the sine qua non of understanding radical political Islam, its destructive energy and its social and political violence." --Benjamin Weinthal, <i>Haaretz</i><br><br>"The pundits in particular would benefit immensely from reading <i>Jihad and Jew-Hatred: Islamism, Nazism and the Roots of 9/11</i> by Matthias Kuentzel.... The book definitely dispels the myth that Arab/Muslim anti-Semitism is purely a consequence of the current Middle East conflict with its recounting of the career of Amin al-Husseini, the British appointed grand mufti of Jerusalem.... Kuentzel's book makes a powerful case that irrespective of whatever anger might be justifiable provoked by any specific Israeli (or American) action, it is not the particular instance of 'escalation' that gives rise to anti-Semitism but a preexistent, virulent anti-Semitic ideology that repeatedly escalates the conflict.... Kuentzel's <i>Jihad and Jew-Hatred</i> is a salutary reminder that policymakers and analysts alike would do well to discard any illusions they may have that, by themselves, the right mix of political concessions negotiated by presumably rational statesmen will extinguish the fires of anti-Semitism that have been stoked for so long in certain quarters of the Arab-Muslim world. Only when the full implications of the ideological dimensions of Islamism, including its congenital anti-Semitism, are acknowledged and confronted can one even begin to sketch out a 'road map for peace' that would be realistic in any meaningful way." --J. Peter Pham, <i>American Foreign Policy Interests</i><br><br>"The small, independent Telos Press deserves kudos for publishing this book by a German historian little known in America. Kuentzel takes Islamic theology seriously, which is why his book is so deeply informative. His <i>Jihad and Jew-Hatred</i> is a compelling historical accound of how modern Islamic extremism has been informed by the anti-Semitism of the Third Reich. Better than anyone before him, Kuentzel makes sense the deep and entangling historical ties between European National Socialism and the Muslim Brotherhood." --Fred Siegel, <i>City Journal</i><br><br>"The German scholar Matthias Kuentzel . . . takes anti-Semitism, and in particular its most potent current strain, Muslim anti-Semitism, very seriously indeed. His bracing, even startling, book, <i>Jihad and Jew-Hatred</i> (translated by Colin Meade), reminds us that it is perilous to ignore idiotic ideas if these idiotic ideas are broadly, and fervently, believed. . . . Kuentzel is right to state that we are witnessing a terrible explosion of anti-Jewish hatred in the Middle East, and he is right to be shocked. His invaluable contribution, in fact, is his capacity to be shocked, by the rhetoric of hate and by its consequences. The former Hamas leader Abdel Aziz Rantisi once told me that 'the question is not what the Germans did to the Jews, but what the Jews did to the Germans.' The Jews, he said, deserved their punishment. Kuentzel argues that we should see men like Rantisi for what they are: heirs to the mufti, and heirs to the Nazis." --Jeffrey Goldberg, <i>New York Times</i><br><br>"Heir to the tradition of Critical Theory...Kuentzel's forcefully argued presentation stretches from the origins of twentieth-century Islamism, with the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood in 1928, to the worldwide wave of anti-Semitism that followed the 9/11 attacks....Reading jihadist anti-Semitism through the lens of German history and intellectual traditions, Kuentzel sheds important light on the category of 'Islamofacism.' While he does not dwell on the terminological debate, his treatment is a compelling response to politically correct efforts to prohibit the term....<i>Jihad and Jew-Hatred</i> adds enormously to our understanding of the roots of contemporary terrorism and challenges us to think through the political substance of the contemporary discourse on terror, the war on terror, and the Middle East." --Russell Berman, <i>Telos</i><br><br>"Matthew Kuentzel, a German researcher, tries in <i>Jihad and Jew-Hatred</i> to trace the lineage of current Muslim anti-Semitism and to assess its place in the <i>weltanschauung</i> of contemporary global jihadists. And while a bit thin and sloppy in his research, Kuentzel is grimly illuminating. What he argues is this: To the pristine layer of Muslim anti-Semitism that sprang from the rejection of Muhammad by the Jewish tribes in 7th century Arabia...was added, during the 1930s and the 1940s, a new layer of Jew-hatred rooted in Nazism....Subsequently, there was anti-Semitic cross-fertilization between the Islamists and nationalists.... Israel has for years been at pains to dismiss the 'Palestine' (and anti-Semitic) motivations of global jihadists. But Kuentzel argues that al-Qaida's assault on the West, first announced in 1998, was and is primarily driven by anti-Semitism. Bin Laden identifies the West/America with 'the Jews' and postulates that ,the Jews are determined to achieve world domination'." --Benny Morris, <i>Il Sole 24 Ore</i><br><br>"Kuentzel presents an interpretation of events that differs from the conventional wisdom. His view seems to be the correct one. As opposed to the illusion of the Israeli establishment, which maintains that the 9/11 attack brought about greater understanding of Israel's problems and raised international awareness of terrorism, Kuentzel argues that 9/11 fostered a tsunami of Jew-hatred....<i>Jihad and Jew-Hatred</i> is perhaps the most important work written in the wake of 9/11. One would have expected similar books to appear in Israel, but this did not happen. Therefore, it is imperative that Kuentzel's book be translated into Hebrew and widely distributed as soon as possible so as to extricate Israelis from the collective amnesia regarding both Egypt since the signing of the peace treaties nearly thirty years ago and the PLO and the Palestinians since the Oslo accords of 1993....Whoever wishes to know the future should learn about the past the Kuentzel exposes in <i>Jihad and Jew-Hatred</i>. This book challenges the views of the Western and Israeli elites who are in charge of thought control and molding public opinion." --Amnon Lord, <i>Jewish Political Studies Review</i><br><br>"What animates Mr. Kuentzel's understandable fury is that although Nazi ideology was stamped out in Europe after 1945, it has continued to work its poisonous mission in the Muslim world. He cites Nazi influence on the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, which transformed that nation from one where Jews were respected and influential to on where they had no place.... Mr. Kuentzel draws a clear line from Nazi Berlin to September 11. If there is any comfort to be gained from this book, it is in its author's righteous indignation, informed as it is by what he has learned from his own nation's ability to reject and try to atone for its terrible past." --Martin Rubin, <i>The Washington Times</i></p><h2>The Ethics of Dissent: Managing Guerrilla Government (Public Affairs and Policy Administration Series)</h2><p><p>Guerrillas in government are all around us. They can be as high profile as "Deep Throat," or as low profile as the bureaucrat who belligerently slows the processing of an application for a driver&#x2019;s license. Their dissent stems from dissatisfaction with the actions of public organizations they work for, but they strategically choose not to go public with their concerns. Instead, they work against the wishes&#x2015;either implicitly or explicitly communicated&#x2015;of their superiors and run the spectrum from anti-establishment liberals to fundamentalist conservatives, from constructive contributors to deviant destroyers. Typically guerrilla government is undetected as it is woven into the fabric of the everyday, often mundane, world of bureaucracy.<br><br>Rosemary O&#x2019;Leary shows that the majority of guerrilla government cases are the manifestation of inevitable tensions between bureaucracy and democracy, which yield immense ethical and organizational challenges that all public managers must learn to navigate. To illustrate these tensions and challenges, O&#x2019;Leary presents three in-depth case studies and 21 mini case studies that showcase the range of guerrillas from an official at a regional EPA office to a doctor at a medical school to the director of planning in a county office. O&#x2019;Leary&#x2019;s fresh analysis, combined with great story-telling, underscores the importance of dissent and presents strategies for ways public servants can decide ethically to engage in guerrilla activity, while offering ways public managers can learn to tap into the potentially insightful, creative ideas and energy of dissenters in order to make constructive changes in the system.</p></p><p><p> <b>Rosemary O&#x2032;Leary</b> is the Director of the School of Public Affairs at the University of Kansas (KU), one of the highest ranked programs in local government management in the world.&nbsp; She is also the Edwin O.
